We will perform an action by using the `collect()` method to return a list that contains all of the elements in this RDD."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"03e884cd-4a62-410a-b81d-b1e5b062e051"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def brokenTen(value):\n    \"\"\"Incorrect implementation of the ten function.\n\n    Note:\n        The `if` statement checks an undefined variable `val` instead of `value`.\n\n    Args:\n        value (int): A number.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: Whether `value` is less than ten.\n\n    Raises:\n        NameError: The function references `val`, which is not available in the local or global\n            namespace, so a `NameError` is raised.\n    \"\"\"\n    if (number < 10):\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\nbrokenRDD = data_RDD.filter(brokenTen)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"8eb0b3cc-ee9e-49e0-8452-47c563536de0"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Now we'll see the error\nbrokenRDD.collect()"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"c581a582-bcb4-4acc-8d7a-fbfce9b5bb11"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}},{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"><span class=\"ansi-red-fg\">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>\n<span class=\"ansi-red-fg\">Py4JJavaError</span>                             Traceback (most recent call last)\n<span class=\"ansi-green-fg\">&lt;command-578662782884654&gt;</span> in <span class=\"ansi-cyan-fg\">&lt;module&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold\">      1</span> <span class=\"ansi-red-fg\"># Now we&#39;ll see the error</span>\n<span class=\"ansi-green-fg\">----&gt;

There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.

I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.

However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).&lt;br /&gt;The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I&#39;am getting one myself! :)&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staral&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann&#39;s is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It&#39;s even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann&#39;s variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann&#39;s use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann&#39;s use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann&#39;s becomes too thick and gluey.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don&#39;t have time to make McCann&#39;s Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don&#39;t require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann&#39;s Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann&#39;s regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I&#39;ve ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann&#39;s Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m a fan of the McCann&#39;s steel-cut oats, so I thought I&#39;d give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won&#39;t make you bloat.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann&#39;s instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Abby&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It&#39;s still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..  JERRY REITH...&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.

At $0.30 cents per meal, I don&#39;t understand why everyone on earth isn&#39;t buying this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don&#39;t get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why everyone on earth isn&#39;t this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It&#39;s all good, that&#39;s for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.&lt;br /&gt;  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann&#39;s and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann&#39;s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples &amp; Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.&lt;br /&gt;  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you&#39;ll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you&#39;re a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I have McCann&#39;s Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;We really like the McCann&#39;s steel cut oats but find we don&#39;t cook it up too often.&lt;br /&gt;This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#34;This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn&#39;t have quite as much flavor either.  It didn&#39;t pass muster with my kids, so I probably won&#39;t buy it again.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn&#39;t follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#39;The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I&#39;ll order this brand again, but not the variety. I&#39;ll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#39;This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#34;This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don&#39;t like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not &#34;burn your mouth forever hot&#34;  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#34;This wasn&#39;t in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton&#39;s Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I&#39;m going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin&#39; Peanuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#39;m not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I&#39;ll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He&#39;ll be so insulted.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#34;we&#39;re used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I&#39;ve roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we&#39;ve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store&#39;s candy.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.&#39;),\n (3,\n  &#39;Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was&lt;br /&gt;$3-4 less at Target.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#39;Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer\\&#39;s endurolyte product so it\\&#39;s great, endurance athlete\\&#39;s the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a &#34;salty&#34; taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.&lt;br /&gt;I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you&#39;re set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn\\&#39;t an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The &#34;zero carb&#34; sports drinks didn\\&#39;t help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&#39;ve shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#34;I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn&#39;t take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I&#39;ve been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I&#39;m familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I&#39;ve tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I&#39;ve tasted.  It&#39;s not terrible, but it&#39;s bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#34;If you&#39;re impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I&#39;m concerned. I&#39;m probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin&#39; things. Consumed!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I&#39;m lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!&#34;),\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 359769 bytes of output ***\n\n (3,\n  &#39;Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes.

There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these.

Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;My daughter is outgrowing baby food but will still eat this.  We tried 3rd foods on her and she doesn&#39;t like the texture of them.  This is really good for her and she likes it, so we keep buying it.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;My son loves the Best Earth&#39;s baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for healthy feeding the organic way. All the food I feed my son is through Earth&#39;s Best.&#34;),\n (1,\n  &#39;To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#34;I usually make my baby&#39;s food.... it&#39;s so easy, steam fruits &amp; veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don&#39;t have enough time to cook and I buy Earth&#39;s Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn&#39;t like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn&#39;t eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, &amp; asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this flavor!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;My six month old baby loves the Earth&#39;s Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it&#39;s his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth&#39;s Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin.&#34;),\n (1,\n  &#34;This is my daughter&#39;s  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she&#39;ll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.&lt;br /&gt;I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth&#39;s Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that&#39;s it for us.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I&#39;d continue to buy but I&#39;m moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I didn&#39;t eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don&#39;t recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It&#39;s not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.&#34;),\n (1,\n  &#34;I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter LOVES this food-- it&#39;s actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;Pretty good product.  The taste isn&#39;t the best but it&#39;s definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I am a true Seattle coffee addict, and I have never had a better coffee candy.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This fruit gift really was the perfect gift! Everything was fresh, well packed and tasty looking! And the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too. And tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were! So thank you! I needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected!SO THANK YOU AGAIN! Dharana,San Francisco&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday.  The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy!  I love dark chocolate, so I loved the dark chocolate almonds.  Next time I&#39;ll give the Organic version of this product... to someone close so they share with me  :)&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or &#34;bark&#34; a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy\\&#39;s extract.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present, she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time, I didn&#39;t realize it was so hard to find!  She absolutely loves it, made a great surprise christmas gift.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I&#39;m actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don&#39;t trust the FDA!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn&#39;t had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so he&#39;d shut up.&#34;),\n (1,\n  &#34;I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy&#39;s Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I&#39;d order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn&#39;t taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn&#39;t have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don&#39;t know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won&#39;t buy the teabags again.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Kim:D&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#39;I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree.&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#39;I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff.&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#39;These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or &#34;best by&#34; date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June &#34;use by&#34; date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they\\&#39;re roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon doesn\\&#39;t seem to specify &#34;use by&#34; dates for the food products they sell, so it\\&#39;s a gamble for the purchaser.  I\\&#39;m assuming that Amazon won\\&#39;t ship stuff that has &#34;expired&#34;, but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the &#34;use by&#34; date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it&#39;s very hot, didn&#39;t have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#39;I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be. $13.95 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around $1.09. Now as far as the item itself, this brand of Panang Paste is excellent. The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant. I would recommend the paste but not the price.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Best paste I have tried! So easy to use. Just saute you meat, add veggies, paste, and a tin of coconut milk. Quick and tasty! I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat. It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter.. but the yellow, green, and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out.&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#34;OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn&#39;t even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I&#39;ll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This gravy mix is excellent ... except, don&#39;t use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I&#39;m not from the south, but live in SoFla; where sometimes we get a southern influence. The gravy mix I am reviewing, PIONEER COUNTRY GRAVY is DE-LICIOUS!!! I&#39;ve tried others Publix brand, Mc Cormick, ect, but this is the BEST! BY FAR! I chose to mix 1/2 water 1/2 milk, + 2 cooked, chopped sausage links, and it was phenomenal on my [...]. BISQUICK CHEESE GARLIC BISQUITS (Like Red Lobster&#39;s), served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs. It&#39;s super easy to make and THICK! FINGER LICKIN! MMMmmmm. I heard you can put it on potatoes/veggies and chicken, make soups and add for seasoning. PIONEER BRAND as the name says is A HOMESTYLE, AMERICAN CLASSIC!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother&#39;s white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great, also.  Goes very well over mashed potatoes, meats, etc.  Try it!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don&#39;t think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don&#39;t have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I don&#39;t think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee, but they taste far better than instant coffee.  At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don&#39;t have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all times.&lt;br /&gt;Never have to drink old coffee.  Best way to make iced coffee.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn&#39;t know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I don&#39;t particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folger&#39;s bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I&#39;m not any kind of coffee expert, so I don&#39;t know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I&#39;ve also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in-room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;We can&#39;t have any kind of coffee maker at work, so we&#39;re forced to buy at the in-house coffee shop or Starbuck&#39;s across the street. In this economy, no one wants to pay those high prices, so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks Folgers!!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It&#39;s easy to make without a mess.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Fast, easy and definitely delicious.  Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make.  Good purchase.  Will continue to order from here.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx...&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I&#39;m glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I&#39;ve had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I&#39;ve read about.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha&#39;s products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars...&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product, and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there! It doesn&#39;t compromise of taste either, I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should. If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant, or even just watching you salt intake, this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and&lt;br /&gt;our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the natural ingredients and no calories.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic, habanero, and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater/owner was giving an interview, It sounded interesting. The D.J.&#39;s were sampling the sauce and raving about it, So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery, It&#39;s so good ! I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks,barbecues and party&#39;s. Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This is my favorite hot sauce! I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly.  I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it.  It&#39;s hot, but not without flavor.  I don&#39;t like those sauces that just burn but have no taste.  This has both burn and and awesome flavor.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon (just stumbled across it).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. I will just order and have shipped to my friends. Habanero is my favorite, I love the heat and the tangy spiciness. I also love the pineapple. You will not go wrong ordering this up.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs, sandwiches most anything for a good kick! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL.... My husband Loves this Habenero sauce, its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it. I in fact love the medium sauce- the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it. We used it for everything and you can use it with any meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness. We love the medium &amp; habenero. Kind of like a &#34;HIS &amp; HERS package&#34;. Thank you for your hard work guys! Keep up the hard work.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Man what can i say, this salsa is the bomb!! i have all the different kinds. i have it with almost every meal. the owner is a cool dude, He&#39;s dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox. i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since. dont sleep on this hot sauce!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#34;Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing &#39;habenero&#39; in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you&#39;re looking for hot this ain&#39;t it&#34;),\n (2,\n  &#39;I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&amp;ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:&lt;br /&gt;Jalapenos&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Vinegar&lt;br /&gt;Brown Sugar&lt;br /&gt;Lime Juice&lt;br /&gt;Fish Sauce&lt;br /&gt;Cilantro&lt;br /&gt;Habanero&lt;br /&gt;Garlic&lt;br /&gt;Spice Blend&lt;br /&gt;Salt&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Sorbate&lt;br /&gt;Xanthan Gum&#39;)]</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[43]: [(5,\n  &#39;I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#39;Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as &#34;Jumbo&#34;.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis\\&#39; &#34;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#34; - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#39;If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it.  I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda.  The flavor is very medicinal.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger&#39;s.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Right now I&#39;m mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!

However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).&lt;br /&gt;The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I&#39;am getting one myself! :)&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staral&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann&#39;s is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It&#39;s even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann&#39;s variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann&#39;s use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann&#39;s use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann&#39;s becomes too thick and gluey.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don&#39;t have time to make McCann&#39;s Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don&#39;t require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann&#39;s Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann&#39;s regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I&#39;ve ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann&#39;s Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m a fan of the McCann&#39;s steel-cut oats, so I thought I&#39;d give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won&#39;t make you bloat.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann&#39;s instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Abby&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It&#39;s still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient!&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL .) HE SUGGESTED THAT I TRY IT FOR MY OWN USE ,IN MY STASH . SOMETIMES NATE DOSE NOT GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO SAY NO , SO I ENDED UP TRYING THE APPLE AND CINN . FOUND IT TO BE VERY TASTEFULL WHEN MADE WITH WATER OR POWDERED MILK . IT GOES GOOD WITH O.J. AND COFFEE AND A SLICE OF TOAST AND YOUR READY TO TAKE ON THE WORLD...OR THE DAY AT LEAST..  JERRY REITH...&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.  She\\&#39;s happy, I\\&#39;m happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QW8&#34;&gt;McCANN\\&#39;S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt;&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;The variety packs taste great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don&#39;t understand why everyone on earth isn&#39;t buying this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don&#39;t get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why everyone on earth isn&#39;t this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It&#39;s all good, that&#39;s for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.&lt;br /&gt;  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann&#39;s and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann&#39;s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples &amp; Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.&lt;br /&gt;  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you&#39;ll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you&#39;re a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I have McCann&#39;s Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;McCann&#39;s Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;We really like the McCann&#39;s steel cut oats but find we don&#39;t cook it up too often.&lt;br /&gt;This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#34;This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn&#39;t have quite as much flavor either.  It didn&#39;t pass muster with my kids, so I probably won&#39;t buy it again.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn&#39;t follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#39;The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavor. The regular is fine with brown sugar added. The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK. This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I&#39;ll order this brand again, but not the variety. I&#39;ll get all Maple and Brown Sugar.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#39;This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#34;This oatmeal is not good. Its mushy, soft, I don&#39;t like it. Quaker Oats is the way to go.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not &#34;burn your mouth forever hot&#34;  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us..&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#34;This wasn&#39;t in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton&#39;s Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I&#39;m going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin&#39; Peanuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I&#39;m not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I&#39;ll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He&#39;ll be so insulted.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#34;we&#39;re used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I&#39;ve roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we&#39;ve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store&#39;s candy.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many.&#39;),\n (3,\n  &#39;Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was&lt;br /&gt;$3-4 less at Target.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#39;Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer\\&#39;s endurolyte product so it\\&#39;s great, endurance athlete\\&#39;s the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a &#34;salty&#34; taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.&lt;br /&gt;I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you&#39;re set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn\\&#39;t an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The &#34;zero carb&#34; sports drinks didn\\&#39;t help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&#39;ve shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#34;I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn&#39;t take like Mango at all.  There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice.  I&#39;ve been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I&#39;m familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I&#39;ve tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I&#39;ve tasted.  It&#39;s not terrible, but it&#39;s bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#34;If you&#39;re impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I&#39;m concerned. I&#39;m probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin&#39; things. Consumed!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I&#39;m lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!&#34;),\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 359769 bytes of output ***\n\n (3,\n  &#39;Little Baby Picky will only eat this sometimes.

There is absolutely nothing bad to say about these. I know some people have complained about the poor packaging but I believe that must&#39;ve been fixed b/c I&#39;ve not had any problems at all -- in fact, they securely bubble wrap these, then place them in an air-cushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;My son started eating this when he was around 8 months old; he&#39;s now 14 months old and it&#39;s one of his favorites. Unfortunately, they don&#39;t carry it at the local grocery store (they carry other varieties of Earth&#39;s Best; just not this one or his other favorites, Spinach/Potatoes and Spaghetti with Cheese); they do carry it at some of the Whole Foods so I buy them there. I&#39;m so glad to find them on Amazon! I get TIRED of ringing up a gazillion little jars at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this as a base and mix in other things - bits of cooked broccoli, small pieces of meat.

If we are going somewhere I won&#39;t be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.

She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn&#39;t eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, &amp; asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this flavor!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;My six month old baby loves the Earth&#39;s Best 2nd Sweet Potato Chicken Dinner - it&#39;s his favorite. He seems to love all the Earth&#39;s Best 2nd foods - fruits, vegetables, and dinners. The consistency of the food makes it easy for him to eat - not too thick, not too thin.&#34;),\n (1,\n  &#34;This is my daughter&#39;s  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she&#39;ll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini.&lt;br /&gt;I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth&#39;s Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that&#39;s it for us.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I&#39;d continue to buy but I&#39;m moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass jars...shattered too many. They like all the flavors though. Great textures too.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I didn&#39;t eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don&#39;t recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It&#39;s not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.&#34;),\n (1,\n  &#34;I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter LOVES this food-- it&#39;s actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;Pretty good product.  The taste isn&#39;t the best but it&#39;s definitely not the worse either.  It gives a pretty smooth energetic kick.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I am a true Seattle coffee addict, and I have never had a better coffee candy.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;Sent this basket to my father for his birthday.  He said the fruit was very fresh and sweet.  Happy with this healthy purchase!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This fruit gift really was the perfect gift! Everything was fresh, well packed and tasty looking! And the people that received it assured me that it was quite tasty tasting too. And tried the chocolate covered cherries ad was surprised at how delicious they were! So thank you! I needed something in a pinch and it came even earlier than expected!SO THANK YOU AGAIN! Dharana,San Francisco&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I got it for my Girlfriend for her Birthday.  The Fruit actually tasted fresh and yummy!  I love dark chocolate, so I loved the dark chocolate almonds.  Next time I&#39;ll give the Organic version of this product... to someone close so they share with me  :)&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;As a child my facorite memory was drinking Sassafras tea made from fresh sassafras with my Granddad. I have never seen it in a tea bag before. I found that to get the taste I remember I needed 2 bags per cup. The bags are rather fragile but all in all it is a really great product that I will buy again and again. Plus the shipping time was great.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or &#34;bark&#34; a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy\\&#39;s extract.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I ordered this on-line and received it in just a few days (3).  The tea is excellent and the price was right for  me.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present, she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time, I didn&#39;t realize it was so hard to find!  She absolutely loves it, made a great surprise christmas gift.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I heard some great things about Sassafras and wanted to try it.  I was worried about the taste but it turned out to be a lot better than i anticipated.  I&#39;m actually gonna order the 4-pack and continue drinking it over time.  Don&#39;t trust the FDA!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;bought this for my dad. for about 2 years he would complain to be about how he hasn&#39;t had this tea since he was about 9. finally, after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed, i bought him the tea so he&#39;d shut up.&#34;),\n (1,\n  &#34;I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy&#39;s Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I&#39;d order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn&#39;t taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn&#39;t have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don&#39;t know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won&#39;t buy the teabags again.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Great tasting tea I have been looking for a good  Sassafras tea forever.Finally. I will be ordering this product again .&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Kim:D&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#39;I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree.&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#39;I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff.&#39;),\n (2,\n  &#39;These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or &#34;best by&#34; date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June &#34;use by&#34; date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they\\&#39;re roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon doesn\\&#39;t seem to specify &#34;use by&#34; dates for the food products they sell, so it\\&#39;s a gamble for the purchaser.  I\\&#39;m assuming that Amazon won\\&#39;t ship stuff that has &#34;expired&#34;, but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the &#34;use by&#34; date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it&#39;s very hot, didn&#39;t have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again.&#34;),\n (3,\n  &#39;I purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that I paid 3 times more than what I should be. $13.95 for 4 cans is highway robbery now that I know that I can purchase one can for around $1.09. Now as far as the item itself, this brand of Panang Paste is excellent. The beef panang dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the Thai restaurant. I would recommend the paste but not the price.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Best paste I have tried! So easy to use. Just saute you meat, add veggies, paste, and a tin of coconut milk. Quick and tasty! I am on weight watchers and tried using the light coconut milk instead of the full fat. It works for the panang paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter.. but the yellow, green, and red are spicy and need the full fat coconut milk to balance it out.&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#34;OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn&#39;t even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I&#39;ll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This gravy mix is excellent ... except, don&#39;t use water where called for, use milk instead, and it makes it 100% better!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I&#39;m not from the south, but live in SoFla; where sometimes we get a southern influence. The gravy mix I am reviewing, PIONEER COUNTRY GRAVY is DE-LICIOUS!!! I&#39;ve tried others Publix brand, Mc Cormick, ect, but this is the BEST! BY FAR! I chose to mix 1/2 water 1/2 milk, + 2 cooked, chopped sausage links, and it was phenomenal on my [...]. BISQUICK CHEESE GARLIC BISQUITS (Like Red Lobster&#39;s), served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs. It&#39;s super easy to make and THICK! FINGER LICKIN! MMMmmmm. I heard you can put it on potatoes/veggies and chicken, make soups and add for seasoning. PIONEER BRAND as the name says is A HOMESTYLE, AMERICAN CLASSIC!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother&#39;s white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I have used Pioneer Gravy for a number of years.  It is VERY easy to make and tastes great, also.  Goes very well over mashed potatoes, meats, etc.  Try it!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Its great to be able to get sugar this way.Its not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processed to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your body,and i am helping the  fair trade farmers.It is a good thing all around.I am happy i can get it in Amazon.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I am a coffee fanatic but have always stayed away from these because I never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar.  I really enjoy the Starbucks VIA instant coffee - but I drink so much, it is rather expensive so I thought I would give this a try.  Both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the taste.  I don&#39;t think it equals fresh brewed but it is very acceptable.  I bought my first 38 pack at my local grocery store for about $7.  That seemed a little high but I figured I would check online to find the best price.  As I started calculating all of the online prices, they are charging about $7 bucks for the 19 count.  I would suggest that you check your local grocery stores as you might be able to find it cheaper.  So you don&#39;t have to do the math...$7 / 38 = .184 per single.  Online price $27 / 114 = .236 (shipping not calculated in).  Looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier, you can get a case of 12 boxes for $69, no sales tax and free shipping...sounds like a great deal??  12 x 19 = 228 singles so $69 / 228 = .302 per single - the most expensive at all.&#34;),\n (4,\n  &#34;I don&#39;t think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh brewed coffee, but they taste far better than instant coffee.  At work, we have a water cooler with hot water dispenser.  This brewed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee.  I highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but don&#39;t have access to a coffee maker.  Individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I keep Regular bags and Decaf bags in my home at all times.&lt;br /&gt;Never have to drink old coffee.  Best way to make iced coffee.&#39;),\n (4,\n  &#39;I live in the dorms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this. Especially when I need to stay up late to study or to wake up after 2 hours of sleep. Its just like making tea and tastes decent enough. Not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;My primary point with this review is to note that this packaging is less expensive than the other size offered by Folger. You get more coffee for less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years. Since I didn&#39;t know how many cups a day I would use, I wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker. I don&#39;t particularly like instant coffee. I was delighted to find these Folger&#39;s bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  They brew a very nice tasting cup of coffee. I&#39;m not any kind of coffee expert, so I don&#39;t know what special terms might be used. All I know is that if I let the bag seep for a bit more than a minute, it sure tastes good. Thanks to my very much better half, I&#39;ve also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Very convenient, very easy, very tasty. I intend to take some of these with me when I travel as an alternative to the in-room coffee makers or (yeck!) vending machines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;We can&#39;t have any kind of coffee maker at work, so we&#39;re forced to buy at the in-house coffee shop or Starbuck&#39;s across the street. In this economy, no one wants to pay those high prices, so we started a coffee club. 20 of us buy these coffee bags and separate creamer and enjoy fresh, hot, tasty coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices. thanks Folgers!!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#34;These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It&#39;s easy to make without a mess.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;Fast, easy and definitely delicious.  Makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make.  Good purchase.  Will continue to order from here.&lt;br /&gt;Thanx...&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit. And I&#39;m glad I did. It has a somewhat sweet and almost minty taste and a wonderful aroma. It has a nice reddish color. This tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green matcha tea I&#39;ve had, and I look forward to experiencing any of the purported health benefits of rooibos that I&#39;ve read about.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I tried this before having normal red tea so I waited to review. The flavor still rings in my head it is earthier than rooibos tea and less frity. The color is that of muddy water, and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well. Well worth every penny.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I previously tried other matcha products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price.  I decided to give Pure Matcha green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive.  The quality of Pure Matcha&#39;s products surpasses that of all others I have tried- stays fresh, has a consistent texture and tastes great.  Both the quality and price are better than others that I have purchased for the same quantity.  I highly recommend Pure Matcha and will continue to purchase.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This is the very best marinade you can buy as far as I am concerned---of course, everyone to his or her own tastes, but all in all, I think anyone will like it---I give it five stars...&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;This is a great product for those looking for an MSG and Gluten free product, and is also lower sodium than any other marinade or soy sauce out there! It doesn&#39;t compromise of taste either, I use it as a Soy Sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marinade should. If you are Celiac or Gluten intolerant, or even just watching you salt intake, this product is a way to have your steak and marinade it too!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;My poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try and&lt;br /&gt;our family really enjoyed it. I looked at the ingredients and was quite pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the natural ingredients and no calories.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This hot sauce is one of my favorites. Its a perfect balance of tasty and spicy. You can smell the flavors immediately when you open the bottle. A mix of garlic, habanero, and other spices. I put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;I was never much of a hot sauce fan until I tasted Black Market Hot Sauce. I was listning to the radio one morning and the creater/owner was giving an interview, It sounded interesting. The D.J.&#39;s were sampling the sauce and raving about it, So I picked up a bottle at the local grocery, It&#39;s so good ! I keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucks,barbecues and party&#39;s. Happy to see I can buy it online at Amazon.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This is my favorite hot sauce! I liketo use it to give anything some extra flavor. I have loved going out to some of my favorite resturants in town and seeing that they are offering this great product.I really enjoy putting on my my breakfast burritos!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;They have this in a local diner that I eat in regularly.  I use it on all kinds of foods and I love it.  It&#39;s hot, but not without flavor.  I don&#39;t like those sauces that just burn but have no taste.  This has both burn and and awesome flavor.  I was surprised to find it on Amazon (just stumbled across it).  I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce.&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;I was browsing around on Amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here. I will just order and have shipped to my friends. Habanero is my favorite, I love the heat and the tangy spiciness. I also love the pineapple. You will not go wrong ordering this up.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;This is my favorite hot sauce. I buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have. Hopefully the other flavors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy! My favorites are the medium and pineapple flavored ones so far. Thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;absolutely love the habenaro sauce...use it on eggs, sandwiches most anything for a good kick! have watched the progessing popularity of theis homegrown product...have nothing but the highes accolades for the chef and the product..get out there and try it!&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#39;BLACK MARKET HOT SAUCE IS WONDERFUL.... My husband Loves this Habenero sauce, its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it. I in fact love the medium sauce- the taste is so yummy with a bit of zing behind it. We used it for everything and you can use it with any meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that there are so many different levels of spicyness. We love the medium &amp; habenero. Kind of like a &#34;HIS &amp; HERS package&#34;. Thank you for your hard work guys! Keep up the hard work.&#39;),\n (5,\n  &#34;Man what can i say, this salsa is the bomb!! i have all the different kinds. i have it with almost every meal. the owner is a cool dude, He&#39;s dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox. i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since. dont sleep on this hot sauce!!&#34;),\n (5,\n  &#39;this sauce is so good with just about anything, i like adding it to asian food or anything with egg or noodles, it has a good burn with a strong flavor. im hoping to see some of the other flavors like the pineapple experiment on here soon. buy it you wont regret it&#39;),\n (1,\n  &#34;Not hot at all. Like the other low star reviewer, I got suckered by seeing &#39;habenero&#39; in the name and the 12 oz size. Some people might like the flavor, citrus-y and it has some fish sauce in the mix (according to the ingredient label), but if you&#39;re looking for hot this ain&#39;t it&#34;),\n (2,\n  &#39;I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&amp;ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:&lt;br /&gt;Jalapenos&lt;br /&gt;Water&lt;br /&gt;Vinegar&lt;br /&gt;Brown Sugar&lt;br /&gt;Lime Juice&lt;br /&gt;Fish Sauce&lt;br /&gt;Cilantro&lt;br /&gt;Habanero&lt;br /&gt;Garlic&lt;br /&gt;Spice Blend&lt;br /&gt;Salt&lt;br /&gt;Potassium Sorbate&lt;br /&gt;Xanthan Gum&#39;)]</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Combine text based on score\ncombined_by_key = review_text_score.reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a+ \" \" + b)\ncombined_by_key.collect()"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"85f79cb6-1ae0-48d4-a7b2-2978f2160d9d"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[44]: [(5,\n  &#39;I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most. Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal. This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger\\&#39;s.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it! This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!! Right now I\\&#39;m mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding. I don\\&#39;t know if it\\&#39;s the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn\\&#39;t find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don\\&#39;t want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the personal, incredible service! One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn\\&#39;t.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week. The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I. My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It\\&#39;s exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers. I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more. Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y &amp; S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y &amp; S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me. My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We\\&#39;ve bought these many times from Amazon because we\\&#39;re government employees living overseas and can\\&#39;t get them in the country we are assigned to.  They\\&#39;ve always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner. I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.&lt;br /&gt;There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM&#34;&gt;Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt; I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn\\&#39;t dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won\\&#39;t be disappointed with. I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it. I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!&lt;br /&gt;Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I\\&#39;m able to buy them right now. Product received is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM&#34;&gt;Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt; I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she\\&#39;s the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they\\&#39;re sugar-free and it\\&#39;s so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i\\&#39;ve ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i\\&#39;ll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.&lt;br /&gt;These are just EXCELLENT! I don\\&#39;t know if it\\&#39;s the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn\\&#39;t find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don\\&#39;t want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the personal, incredible service! I have never been a huge coffee fan. However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).&lt;br /&gt;The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I\\&#39;am getting one myself! :) This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staral Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann\\&#39;s Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann\\&#39;s regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I\\&#39;ve ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann\\&#39;s Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann\\&#39;s instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Abby What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It\\&#39;s still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient! I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.  She\\&#39;s happy, I\\&#39;m happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QW8&#34;&gt;McCANN\\&#39;S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt; The variety packs taste great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don\\&#39;t understand why everyone on earth isn\\&#39;t buying this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don\\&#39;t get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why everyone on earth isn\\&#39;t this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap... McCann\\&#39;s makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It\\&#39;s all good, that\\&#39;s for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.&lt;br /&gt;  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann\\&#39;s and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann\\&#39;s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples &amp; Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.&lt;br /&gt;  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you\\&#39;ll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you\\&#39;re a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal. I have McCann\\&#39;s Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy McCann\\&#39;s Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent. We really like the McCann\\&#39;s steel cut oats but find we don\\&#39;t cook it up too often.&lt;br /&gt;This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing. Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn\\&#39;t follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of. Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not &#34;burn your mouth forever hot&#34;  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us.. We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we\\&#39;ve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much. Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store\\&#39;s candy. It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more. Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies! Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many. This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer\\&#39;s endurolyte product so it\\&#39;s great, endurance athlete\\&#39;s the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a &#34;salty&#34; taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough. This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.&lt;br /&gt;I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line. This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you\\&#39;re set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy. For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn\\&#39;t an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The &#34;zero carb&#34; sports drinks didn\\&#39;t help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&#39;ve shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work..... this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I\\&#39;m concerned. I\\&#39;m probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin\\&#39; things. Consumed! Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I\\&#39;m lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious! I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I\\&#39;ve ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed. These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I\\&#39;ve been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won\\&#39;t order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up. These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!! i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp. This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I\\&#39;m 30 now and I love it! I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don\\&#39;t let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured &#34;food&#34; items.  I really don\\&#39;t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\&#39;s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don\\&#39;t use any low-fat milk. Or don\\&#39;t add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great. We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping. My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won\\&#39;t cause her pain. My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it\\&#39;s $10 cheaper and free shipping! Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy\\&#39;s and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn\\&#39;t have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy\\&#39;s or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet. Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages &amp; breeds. Ît\\&#39;s a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!! I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance. This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him. This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :) My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I\\&#39;ve ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn\\&#39;t have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it. This is the same food we get at pet store. But it\\&#39;s delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less. I\\&#39;ve been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven\\&#39;t had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs. My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He\\&#39;s been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he\\&#39;d eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you\\&#39;re actually getting more &#34;bang for your buck&#34; with the natural dog foods since you don\\&#39;t have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I\\&#39;m sold!! Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap \\&#39;you can buy it anywhere\\&#39; food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.&lt;br /&gt;This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved. My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It\\&#39;s for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef). The mouth says, &#34;How do I love thee, let me count the ways...&#34;&lt;br /&gt;If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy. These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are! What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed. I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more! I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I\\&#39;m going to order the six pack and I\\&#39;m a household of one. They wont go to waste! I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn\\&#39;t believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I\\&#39;ve got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!! I\\&#39;m presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That\\&#39;s how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I\\&#39;ve always liked asparagus anyway and I\\&#39;ve enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It\\&#39;s the best I can recall. There\\&#39;s an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I\\&#39;m looking forward to eating. I can\\&#39;t believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says &#34;only 60 calories per jar!&#34; Now this is my idea of a good diet food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor\\&#39;s office because it wasn\\&#39;t available elsewhere.  I\\&#39;m so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste. I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays &#34;NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS&#34; (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays &#34;CAFFENE FREE&#34;.  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it. this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it\\&#39;s clean, bright, fresh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great delivery...again quality... just try it... I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don\\&#39;t get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday! I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try. I\\&#39;m Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn\\&#39;t find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it\\&#39;s great to have them again. In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids! I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor\\&#39;s request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he\\&#39;s eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can\\&#39;t see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I\\&#39;ll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&#39;m updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he\\&#39;s just a big cat who doesn\\&#39;t exercise much, let\\&#39;s face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she\\&#39;s so healthy. She\\&#39;s tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I\\&#39;ve ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it. I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his &#34;spunk&#34; so I decided it was time to start buying him &#34;real&#34; cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I\\&#39;m sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he\\&#39;s now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals! I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select. This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn\\&#39;t eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food. I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI\\&#39;s under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It\\&#39;s expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me. Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova\\&#39;s manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&amp;Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters. My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don\\&#39;t want to be rude, so I\\&#39;ll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select! One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also. Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book! I\\&#39;ve been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I\\&#39;ve never found a better flavor than Hot &amp; Spicy Chicken!  It isn\\&#39;t hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good! Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in. I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren\\&#39;t used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough. Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can\\&#39;t escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale. i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon The BEST investment I\\&#39;ve ever made for ginger. It\\&#39;s unbelievable! It\\&#39;s fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it\\&#39;s perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It\\&#39;s very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I\\&#39;ll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :) Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I\\&#39;ve purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling. I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down. My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it! I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.&lt;br /&gt;Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!! If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They\\&#39;re soft, easy to chew, and they don\\&#39;t get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend! Being a fan of Newman\\&#39;s Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I\\&#39;ve ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don\\&#39;t like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it\\&#39;s mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it\\&#39;s a steal! This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money. This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor. This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor &amp; flair, I\\&#39;ve even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it! Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful. I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it\\&#39;s only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn\\&#39;t find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy! What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will. Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely. &lt;span class=&#34;tiny&#34;&gt; Length:: 0:26 Mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.&lt;br /&gt;edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn\\&#39;t do a good job focusing on the tuna.&lt;br /&gt;I should film it over, but it doesn\\&#39;t look like many people view this product anyway. I\\&#39;ve never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning. these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to \\&#39;dress it up\\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe a little heating brings out the flavor. I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven\\&#39;t made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It\\&#39;s dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It\\&#39;s just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I\\&#39;m going to try making fesenjan next :-) Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff! I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag. I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.&lt;br /&gt;It\\&#39;s much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,&lt;br /&gt;and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring&lt;br /&gt;back. Check it out. I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product! I couldn\\&#39;t wait to try the 8&amp;#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&amp;#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really &#34;takes the cake&#34; with size, price, quality and taste.&lt;br /&gt;The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn\\&#39;t believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you\\&#39;ve got the perfect breakfast treat! One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying it. This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don\\&#39;t need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again and again. Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it\\&#39;s really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with. This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING! We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn\\&#39;t discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it. This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town. We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores. This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something &#34;strawberry&#34; should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively &#34;healthy&#34; fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I\\&#39;ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it\\&#39;s still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You\\&#39;ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base. My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. It\\&#39;s tolerablel. This coffee is great because it\\&#39;s all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma. Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I\\&#39;ve tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is \\&#39;Africafe pure instant coffee\\&#39; Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging. These little guys are tasty and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They\\&#39;re sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they\\&#39;re tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good bulk value buy and I\\&#39;\n*** WARNING: skipped 349361 bytes of output ***\n\n</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[44]: [(5,\n  &#39;I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most. Great taffy at a great price.  There was a wide assortment of yummy taffy.  Delivery was very quick.  If your a taffy lover, this is a deal. This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy.  Each candy was individually wrapped well.  None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger\\&#39;s.  Would highly recommend this candy!  I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it! This taffy is so good.  It is very soft and chewy.  The flavors are amazing.  I would definitely recommend you buying it.  Very satisfying!! Right now I\\&#39;m mostly just sprouting this so my cats can eat the grass. They love it. I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion. Also good for small puppies. My dog eats her required amount at every feeding. I don\\&#39;t know if it\\&#39;s the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!  When we realized that we simply couldn\\&#39;t find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don\\&#39;t want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan.  Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the personal, incredible service! One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn\\&#39;t.  I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump.  The higher food sits going stale.  They both really go for this food.  And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week. The Strawberry Twizzlers are my guilty pleasure - yummy. Six pounds will be around for a while with my son and I. My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It\\&#39;s exactly what you would expect...six packages of strawberry twizzlers. I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase.  I shared these with others and we have all enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering more. Twizzlers, Strawberry my childhood favorite candy, made in Lancaster Pennsylvania by Y &amp; S Candies, Inc. one of the oldest confectionery Firms in the United States, now a Subsidiary of the Hershey Company, the Company was established in 1845 as Young and Smylie, they also make Apple Licorice Twists, Green Color and Blue Raspberry Licorice Twists, I like them all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it in a dry cool place because is not recommended it to put it in the fridge. According to the Guinness Book of Records, the longest Licorice Twist ever made measured 1.200 Feet (370 M) and weighted 100 Pounds (45 Kg) and was made by Y &amp; S Candies, Inc. This Record-Breaking Twist became a Guinness World Record on July 19, 1998. This Product is Kosher! Thank You Candy was delivered very fast and was purchased at a reasonable price.  I was home bound and unable to get to a store so this was perfect for me. My husband is a Twizzlers addict.  We\\&#39;ve bought these many times from Amazon because we\\&#39;re government employees living overseas and can\\&#39;t get them in the country we are assigned to.  They\\&#39;ve always been fresh and tasty, packed well and arrive in a timely manner. I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.&lt;br /&gt;There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM&#34;&gt;Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt; I can remember buying this candy as a kid and the quality hasn\\&#39;t dropped in all these years. Still a superb product you won\\&#39;t be disappointed with. I love this candy.  After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it. I have lived out of the US for over 7 yrs now, and I so miss my Twizzlers!!  When I go back to visit or someone visits me, I always stock up.  All I can say is YUM!&lt;br /&gt;Sell these in Mexico and you will have a faithful buyer, more often than I\\&#39;m able to buy them right now. Product received is as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM&#34;&gt;Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt; I got this for my Mum who is not diabetic but needs to watch her sugar intake, and my father who simply chooses to limit unnecessary sugar intake - she\\&#39;s the one with the sweet tooth - they both LOVED these toffees, you would never guess that they\\&#39;re sugar-free and it\\&#39;s so great that you can eat them pretty much guilt free!  i was so impressed that i\\&#39;ve ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i\\&#39;ll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets.&lt;br /&gt;These are just EXCELLENT! I don\\&#39;t know if it\\&#39;s the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind!  We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away!

However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato. No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinker!).&lt;br /&gt;The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up). I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone. Too good for the price and I\\&#39;am getting one myself! :) This offer is a great price and a great taste, thanks Amazon for selling this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staral Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann\\&#39;s Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann\\&#39;s regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I\\&#39;ve ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCann\\&#39;s Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6) For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store!  I love McCann\\&#39;s instant oatmeal - all flavors!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Abby What else do you need to know? Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds). More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something. It\\&#39;s still just oatmeal. Mmm, convenient! I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.  She\\&#39;s happy, I\\&#39;m happy!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QW8&#34;&gt;McCANN\\&#39;S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples &amp; Cinnamon, and Maple &amp; Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)&lt;/a&gt; The variety packs taste great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don\\&#39;t understand why everyone on earth isn\\&#39;t buying this stuff up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don\\&#39;t get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why everyone on earth isn\\&#39;t this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap... McCann\\&#39;s makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It\\&#39;s all good, that\\&#39;s for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.&lt;br /&gt;  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann\\&#39;s and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann\\&#39;s is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples &amp; Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.&lt;br /&gt;  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you\\&#39;ll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you\\&#39;re a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal. I have McCann\\&#39;s Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product. Tastes great and very healthy McCann\\&#39;s Oatmeal is a good quality choice.  Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary.  For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent. We really like the McCann\\&#39;s steel cut oats but find we don\\&#39;t cook it up too often.&lt;br /&gt;This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing. Good oatmeal.  I like the apple cinnamon the best.  Though I wouldn\\&#39;t follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste.  That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of. Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked..lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them...  So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,...  well now there is.  They are Hot,  but not &#34;burn your mouth forever hot&#34;  its a nice temp...  Perfect for us.. We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time).  The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too.  More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste.  On numerous occasions, we\\&#39;ve had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much. Deal was awesome!  Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters.  I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store\\&#39;s candy. It is chocolate, what can I say.  Great variety of everything our family loves.  With a family of six it goes fast here.  Perfect variety.  Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more. Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size!  The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly.  The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies! Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share. The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many. This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer\\&#39;s endurolyte product so it\\&#39;s great, endurance athlete\\&#39;s the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a &#34;salty&#34; taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough. This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.&lt;br /&gt;I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line. This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides. Pop 1 into each water bottle and you\\&#39;re set. Flavor is fine and goes down easy. For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn\\&#39;t an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The &#34;zero carb&#34; sports drinks didn\\&#39;t help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&#39;ve shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work..... this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds! my fault These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality. The bears even have little faces. At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/lb. These twin packs of 4.5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I\\&#39;m concerned. I\\&#39;m probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin\\&#39; things. Consumed! Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I\\&#39;m lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious! I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting. It arrived fresh and intact. Very good size. I froze half for later use. I am a pastry lover and these were the best I\\&#39;ve ever tasted. The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great. They were gone in no time. My guests were really impressed. These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix.  Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate.  I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey.  I through them in the fridge and I\\&#39;ve been breaking off hunks ever since.  They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again.  I won\\&#39;t order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up. These taste really good. I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture. I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summer. There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items. Order in cold weather and buy enough to last!!! i know i cannot make tea this good.  granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet.  it tastes crisp. This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat.  My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl.  I\\&#39;m 30 now and I love it! I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don\\&#39;t let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured &#34;food&#34; items.  I really don\\&#39;t think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it\\&#39;s own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don\\&#39;t use any low-fat milk. Or don\\&#39;t add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great. We have three dogs and all of them love this food!  We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping. My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food. She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has. After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand. So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this! She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won\\&#39;t cause her pain. My shepherd/collie mix has IBS.  Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food.  This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it.  I will always buy it from Amazon...it\\&#39;s $10 cheaper and free shipping! Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell. She has awful food allergy\\&#39;s and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn\\&#39;t have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to. She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy\\&#39;s or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet. Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages &amp; breeds. Ît\\&#39;s a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!! I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food. I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance. This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him. This food is great - all ages dogs.  I have a 3 year old and a puppy.  They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick.  The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :) My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I\\&#39;ve ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn\\&#39;t have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it. This is the same food we get at pet store. But it\\&#39;s delivered to my door! And for the same price or slightly less. I\\&#39;ve been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven\\&#39;t had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs. My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He\\&#39;s been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he\\&#39;d eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you\\&#39;re actually getting more &#34;bang for your buck&#34; with the natural dog foods since you don\\&#39;t have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I\\&#39;m sold!! Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods. The cheap \\&#39;you can buy it anywhere\\&#39; food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets.  This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food.&lt;br /&gt;This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved. My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It\\&#39;s for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef). The mouth says, &#34;How do I love thee, let me count the ways...&#34;&lt;br /&gt;If you like apple products a must have item.  The only draw back, shipping cost.  These are very heavy. These are absolutely scrumptuous!  My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship!  The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are! What a nice alternative to an apple pie. Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing. Easy to prepare. I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed. I like Creme Brulee. I loved that these were so easy. Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil. They look amazing and taste great. My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes. I will be ordering more! I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite. Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out.  These are even better than the ones from the Amish market. They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom. I\\&#39;m going to order the six pack and I\\&#39;m a household of one. They wont go to waste! I love asparagus.  Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus.  Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn\\&#39;t believe how great stuff tasted.  I loved it so much I bought the six pack.  I\\&#39;ve got 2 jars left.  Gonna need more!! I\\&#39;m presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods. I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories. I came home with about a dozen items. That\\&#39;s how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I\\&#39;ve always liked asparagus anyway and I\\&#39;ve enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It\\&#39;s the best I can recall. There\\&#39;s an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I\\&#39;m looking forward to eating. I can\\&#39;t believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says &#34;only 60 calories per jar!&#34; Now this is my idea of a good diet food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson I have been drinking this tea for a long time now.  I used to have to purchase it at a doctor\\&#39;s office because it wasn\\&#39;t available elsewhere.  I\\&#39;m so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon.com.  I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee.  Wonderful taste. I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays &#34;NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS&#34; (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays &#34;CAFFENE FREE&#34;.  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it. this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted... it\\&#39;s clean, bright, fresh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great delivery...again quality... just try it... I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don\\&#39;t get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday! I love this tea. It helps curb my eating during the day. My Mom and I have given it all friends to try. I\\&#39;m Italian and I lived in Italy for years. I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso. I couldn\\&#39;t find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it\\&#39;s great to have them again. In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids! I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor\\&#39;s request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he\\&#39;s eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can\\&#39;t see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I\\&#39;ll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\\&#39;m updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he\\&#39;s just a big cat who doesn\\&#39;t exercise much, let\\&#39;s face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she\\&#39;s so healthy. She\\&#39;s tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I\\&#39;ve ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it. I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his &#34;spunk&#34; so I decided it was time to start buying him &#34;real&#34; cat food...not the garbage in the super markets. I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I\\&#39;m sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase. My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he\\&#39;s now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more! I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals! I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food.  That is also according to my holistic veterinarian.  They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me.  The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select. This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight.  It stopped her problems.  She doesn\\&#39;t eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.  Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food. I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI\\&#39;s under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It\\&#39;s expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me. Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova\\&#39;s manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&amp;Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters. My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands. We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version). The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear. AND (and I don\\&#39;t want to be rude, so I\\&#39;ll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me! The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select! One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef. This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet. Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat. Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also. Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book! I\\&#39;ve been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I\\&#39;ve never found a better flavor than Hot &amp; Spicy Chicken!  It isn\\&#39;t hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good! Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in. I really loved the spicy flavor these had.  I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite.  If you aren\\&#39;t used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough. Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can\\&#39;t escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale. i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon The BEST investment I\\&#39;ve ever made for ginger. It\\&#39;s unbelievable! It\\&#39;s fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it\\&#39;s perfect with the sugar - calms it down.  It\\&#39;s very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I\\&#39;ll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :) Delicious. I cannot get Australian ginger where I live. This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I\\&#39;ve purchased in other cities. Now I can enjoy it without traveling. I keep trying other brands.... cheaper brands. Stupid me! This ginger IS soooo worth the money. Tender, moist and never a let down. My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him. I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried. What a surprise! He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning. He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it. This product was a God send for him. Thank you all for it! I love these.........very tasty!!!!!!!!!!!  Infact, I think I am addicted to them.&lt;br /&gt;Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag.  Savings are about a $1.00 a bag.  I use subscribe and save on these and several other product.  I love subscribe and save!!!!!!!!!!! If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these!  They\\&#39;re soft, easy to chew, and they don\\&#39;t get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack! Great item, great price too, highly recommend! Being a fan of Newman\\&#39;s Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I\\&#39;ve ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don\\&#39;t like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it\\&#39;s mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it\\&#39;s a steal! This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack. The other two that come with it are not worth your money. This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor. This is a fabulous marinade!  I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill.  This has enough flavor &amp; flair, I\\&#39;ve even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests!! DEFINITELY worth the price! Super cheap and super easy! Love it! Works with chicken fish beef or pork. Fast easy and makes it taste excellent. Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores AWESOME!!! such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you. I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful. I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here. This jello is wonderful! Evidently it\\&#39;s only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn\\&#39;t find it anywhere in town. This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam! Great made as regular Jello too. Yummy! What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will. Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket.  We love it. Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely. &lt;span class=&#34;tiny&#34;&gt; Length:: 0:26 Mins&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product. The tuna, tomato combination is delicious. This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so.&lt;br /&gt;edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn\\&#39;t do a good job focusing on the tuna.&lt;br /&gt;I should film it over, but it doesn\\&#39;t look like many people view this product anyway. I\\&#39;ve never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea. I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning. these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there. Excellent quality, and no need to \\&#39;dress it up\\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe a little heating brings out the flavor. I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven\\&#39;t made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It\\&#39;s dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It\\&#39;s just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I\\&#39;m going to try making fesenjan next :-) Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange water.  Wonderful, wonderful stuff! I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme! They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy. I purchased 5#. If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag. I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine. I love this stuff in milk.&lt;br /&gt;It\\&#39;s much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk. I am French and live in the US,&lt;br /&gt;and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity. Savora is another hidden gem you can bring&lt;br /&gt;back. Check it out. I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product! I couldn\\&#39;t wait to try the 8&amp;#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&amp;#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really &#34;takes the cake&#34; with size, price, quality and taste.&lt;br /&gt;The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn\\&#39;t believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you\\&#39;ve got the perfect breakfast treat! One of the best lemon juice that I have tried. I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product. When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying it. This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round. It has a powerful flavor and you don\\&#39;t need much of it to zest up a dish. I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again and again. Fast delivery and good product. This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it\\&#39;s really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc. Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with. This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING! We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn\\&#39;t discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it. This  is great stuff.  Made some really tasty banana bread.  Good quality and lowest price in town. We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores. This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something &#34;strawberry&#34; should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively &#34;healthy&#34; fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I\\&#39;ve also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it\\&#39;s still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You\\&#39;ll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base. My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone. The smell is kinda strong, but not bad. It\\&#39;s tolerablel. This coffee is great because it\\&#39;s all organic ingredients!  No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma. Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste. I\\&#39;ve tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones. Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is \\&#39;Africafe pure instant coffee\\&#39; Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters. Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile. But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging. These little guys are tasty and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath.  I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They\\&#39;re sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they\\&#39;re tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good bulk value buy and I\\&#39;\n*** WARNING: skipped 349361 bytes of output ***\n\n</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# tokinize the reviews for each score (split the text into words)\nsplit_by_key = combined_by_key.map(lambda x: (x[0], x[1].split()))"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"7b6a00e9-71cb-45f7-94ce-af1d77da4072"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\"></div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Get the word count for each review score\naa = split_by_key.map(lambda x: (x[0], len(x[1]))) #reduceByKey(lambda a, b: a+b)\naa.collect()"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"349ec1dd-18da-48e7-9ac9-932c2bbcaf30"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[46]: [(5, 44257), (1, 8265), (4, 11148), (2, 3592), (3, 5476)]</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[46]: [(5, 44257), (1, 8265), (4, 11148), (2, 3592), (3, 5476)]</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from operator import add\ncount_=review_text_score.map(lambda x: (x[0], 1)).reduceByKey(add)\ncount_.collect()"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"d8b8c7fd-cd3e-435c-83f4-0cb12a5918b0"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+output":{"datasetInfos":[],"data":"<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[47]: [(5, 642), (1, 98), (4, 138), (2, 47), (3, 75)]</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"metadata":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[47]: [(5, 642), (1, 98), (4, 138), (2, 47), (3, 75)]</div>"]}}],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# get the number of reviews in each score -
