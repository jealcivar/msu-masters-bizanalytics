"November 3, 2020",Lisa Barrett,5.0,251,"I've only had these headphones for a couple of days, but so far I've been impressed. Took them out of the package, charged them and they paired perfectly with my laptop and my Iphone.  NO issues there. I have problems with fitting earbuds in my ear, so I bought these with the plastic ear wraps.  The ear wraps are soft and flexible and not noticeable.  The earbuds fit great and I have no fear of them falling out. The sound is clear.  The quality is comparable to a decent set of headphones.  It's not going to rock your world, but for the price it definitely does what its supposed to. Battery has lived up to expectations.  I used one ear bud for almost 8 hours before getting the ""Low Battery"" warning...  I swapped to the other one with no problem at all. The LED indicators in the case show the power level of the case 0-100 which is great.  The individual power bands don't seem to be registering properly, but this isn't a deal breaker for me. I noticed that the listing said ""Noise-isolating"" not ""Noise-canceling.""  I didn't expect these to be noise canceling, but they do a decent job of covering background noise, again like a decent pair of headphones. Tomorrow I'm going running in them, so I can't speak to that yet, but I tried really hard to get them to fall out.  I'll update the review after the run. It's definitely worth giving a shot at this price point and as a company they seem interested in building a brand, so they actually care about what you think."
"August 7, 2020",Jhaymz88,5.0,166,They paired up fairly easily and they sound clear surprisingly. I was a bit skeptical because you never know these days With products on amazon. I originally thought they sent a black pair on accident because the box showed a photo of a black pair but fortunately it was correct. Overall they are a nice replacement for a guy like me who constantly loses their AirPods and don’t went to spend $150 every time for a new pair
"September 6, 2020",Haeyeon,5.0,154,This is a wonderful product! They are very comfortable with a bendable rubber piece that wraps around the ear. The directions are easy to figure out with the pamphlet included. The sound quality is good for the price. I love the compact case that shows the battery life for each ear (which lasts long). All in all 10/10.
"September 4, 2020",Mel Co,5.0,130,"Well, so far, so good. Bass is waaay better than another set of sport earbuds I had; it's not thumping, but ir's decent; good enough for me. Also, microphone for phone calls seems to be good, people I've called said they hear me loud and clear, no buzzing or static. I like the case, too, with it's digital display."
"September 21, 2020",Sara,5.0,133,"These are awesome earbuds and they really have great sound quality! They connect with your bluetooth on the phone under ""T17"".  I like the design that wraps around my ear.  I find it very comfortable and don't have any issues with the earbuds falling out. They come with 3 different sized silicone pieces so that you can customise You're fit which makes them extra comfortable. I love that these headphones  have a really long battery life, they can last up to 8 hours on one charge and whenever you put them back in the battery case it fully recharges them up to 6 times. That means that I get 48 hours of use out of the earbuds before I need to recharge the case. The case also shows the battery life levels so that I know when to recharge. The volume and bass are great and you can adjust the volume on the earphones themselves or your phone. You can also use them together or just one and theyre grrat for taking calls ot listening to music! Im definitely a fan!"
"October 11, 2020",Machinist71,5.0,74,"Bought these initially as a back up to my Jlabs ear buds of similar style. These have outperformed the Jlabs in battery life but not quite in sound quality. The sound is quite good but just not quite as crisp as the Jlabs. For online gaming, which I use them most for, these earbuds are now my go to as the Jlabs rarely last more than two to three hours of constant use where the Occiam earbuds last more than 6 hours. (yes, I know, I need to get out more, I blame Covid...) I also like the digital display in the charging case. This indicates how much charge is left in the case battery for recharging. The actual charge of each ear phone is indicated by an LED light bar with a 4 LED  scale for each ear phone. On a side note, I have not paired these with my phone. I probably will when I go hiking and may update the review when that happens. In the end, I am VERY happy with the performance, the battery life and of course the price. I will be buying a second pair of these real soon to be back ups to my first pair."
"August 18, 2020",Udaya,5.0,79,I had used AirPods from friend even though I didn’t own one.. and compared the quality of the same with this one and seems really impressive for the money! Good battery life too and this will help me with both my zoom meetings and cardio efforts at the gym! Really a great buy!
"December 2, 2020",dodee B.,5.0,52,"Great pair of headphones at the right price point. I have two little kids and I move around a lot at work and I do a lot of chores at home have long days and having a dependable headphones that just work is important. I've had them for a couple weeks and so far they connect to the Bluetooth every time without failure. The sound quality is good I think for the price, no complaints. the most fabulous thing about these headphones is the fit if inside the ear tiny buds don't work for you this might. They are very light and the fit is very lite on the ear. It's lovely. The displays inside the case are fine they're bright they work. The other favorite thing that I like about these headphones is that they have a button instead of a touch pad. And I like a button that clicks. It's more dependable I know it's not going to come on inside of my pocket if I have to throw my headphones inside my pocket at work. Definitely a big button fan over the touchpad. Yeah nothing less than five stars at this price."
"September 22, 2020",jla,5.0,56,"I love these headphones! Great price and work the same as most expensive ones. I only wear one at a time when I'm doing things around the house and the sound quality is excellent. The range seems to work pretty well too. I leave my phone in the kitchen a lot to go a level up or a level down in my house and I can still hear crystal clear. My husband was trying to talk to me the other night while I only had one side in and nothing was playing on my phone at the time. He was about 6 feet away and I couldn't make out clearly what he was trying to say so I had to take the piece out. Obviously the noise cancelation part works great! They are also really comfortable and don't hurt the inside of my ear like the style that are just buds do. The charge lasts a long time. I wear one side during most of the day, about 6 hours and never had to recharge it. They come with the charging cord you'd need, its a newer version. The kind that came with my galaxy s10. Pairing is easy as well. I did have one issue with one of the ear buds  sound going in and out but i emailed the customer care team and they quickly responded to resolve the situation. I haven't found anything I dont like about them yet besides you can't travel too far from your connected device but for me the distance is perfect."
"April 24, 2021",sean,1.0,32,Update: first off these are reviewed well due to the company offering a free pair for a 5 start review.. secondly after leaving my negative review I was offered a gift card as a refund only if I removed my negative review.. again spending the extra money and buy from a good company not one that does shady practices.. I liked these headphones initially as a cheap alternative. After minimul use now the charging case will not work at all. There is no way to charge the headphones. Spend the extra money and get better ones
"December 3, 2020",Dinardo,5.0,34,"THESE HAVE GONE BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS AND I LOVE THEM!!!! My husband has wireless headphones and always complains about them not working about 6 months into using them, so I was expecting a cheap pair that would last me a few months and I’d have to replace. NOPE. These headphones  1. Have great sound quality. 2. The battery life is excellent, I use them all the time and rarely run out of charge/do not charge them that often. 3. Are resilient! Let me tell you a story....... I used these outside working in the yard and left them on my windshield to remind myself to bring them indoors... of course I forgot to bring them in. I also forgot I left them there, so the next morning leaving for work my windshield was frosted so I turned on the wipers and left for work. When I got to work I remembered I forgot them on my windshield. I searched my windshield to not find them anywhere. Devastated that I thought I might have lost them driving on the highway, I was about to order replacements. When I got home I thought, “well maybe the wipers threw them in the driveway.” SURE ENOUGH I found them in my driveway, they had been sitting in the rain for 4+ hours, AND I RAN THEM OVER.  The darn things still work. The case is cracked but the earpieces themselves are perfect, and they still charge. BUY THESE WIRELESS HEADPHONES!!!!!!!!!!"
"October 8, 2020",Dj Kevie Kev.,5.0,39,This pair of Occiam Bluetooth Headphones are the best bluetooth headphones I've ever had. Speaking from a DJs point of view the sound is amazing and it has incredible bass with clear highs. The phone quality is excellent with very clear voice sounds and a very clean microphone for so peaking. The battery life is very good it lasted me all day and I was at 68% at the end of my work day. I would and I am going to highly recommend the Occiam Bluetooth Headphones to anyone who wants a excellent quality pair of headphones at a very affordable price.
"October 12, 2020",@junevreyes,5.0,21,"Upon receiving this product two days ago, I first charged the case with the earbuds in it, as customary before first usage. After the case was fully charged at 100, I noticed that the left earbud is still charging. So I waited for another 2 hours to give it more time to fully charge. But only the right earbud is fully charged and the left one is still charging. I thought it’s just a glitch, as it happened sometimes on electronics. So I decided to use it instead of waiting till the left one is fully charged. I’m really liking it, coz it fit my ears perfectly. I’m also impressed with the sound, just perfectly balanced for me. But after 3 hours, a prompt voice notify me the left earbud is low battery. Surprised, it supposed to last 8 hrs as stated on its product description. So I charged it again and waited few hrs. Again, the right one fully charged right away. But the left one is still charging. To my disappointment, the left one is still charging. I don’t think this isn’t normal. So I emailed the customer service for help. After few emails exchanged, the company decided to send me a new one and let me keep the defective one. I’m amazed with the courtesy and concern they provided me. Kudos to the great customer service of this company."
"February 19, 2021",Kindle Customer,1.0,14,"Bought these for my fiancé for work , the sound was good but they have already stopped working on the right side after less then two months( even with only a few hours of use each night and gentle use) . We also were supposed to get a free pair from a card the seller sent with the order but that never happened either.. Won't be buying from them again at this point... Update : so a month later and I get an email from this seller : ""I am sorry that there is a problem with the quality of our products. If you are willing to delete your review, we are willing to refund you $ 30 as an apology. We are collecting feedback and improving the product."" Steer clear of this seller ,they don't stand behind their products and don't even offer a refund for the purchase price .."
"February 23, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,33,"After two weeks of use the left earbud will no longer charge. I have cleaned the contacts on both charger and earbud as instructed. Pretty sad. Update: I have now purchased, returned, and repurchased THREE SETS of these headphones. After 1-2 months of use ALL THREE SETS of them had cutout issues, then stopped charging the left earbud. One manufacturing defect I can handle. BUT THREE IN A ROW? Garbage."
"November 19, 2020",Julie,5.0,14,"So far I am very happy with the product. My coworkers say the mic picks me up clearly and the audio is good too. My husband said the wires earbuds from Apple are better but if I hadn’t done a comparison mid call he wouldn’t have noticed the difference. I like the smallest size ear pads, they are very comfortable for my ear (most are usually too big and hurt after a bit). I like that I can use both or one earbuds as I need or want. I like the storage case and the charge indicator. They pair very easily and and are comfortable to wear. I decided I needed a Bluetooth earbud set after my cat caused a phone catastrophe, getting caught on the wire from my wired earbuds, yanking the phone off the table, and shattering my phone (even with a case on)."
"April 9, 2021",Andre Krell,1.0,11,"UPDATE 04/2021 - The seller sent a new device (thank you; it was much appreciated). I'll give it a try and report whether it was a defective device in a few weeks time. After About 1 month of use, the right piece stopped working. It’s fully charged and the Bluetooth connection seems to be OK given the controls (volume and next/previous) do respond. Apparently a faulty wire is preventing the audio to work on the right piece. On top of that the quality of the sound is poor, the microphone doesn’t word well (people can barely hear you in a call) and it’s not ergonomic at all. I’ll probably just toss it in the trash bin..."
"February 8, 2021",Kindle Customer,1.0,15,"I got these for my wife for her birthday to use with her phone.  She uses them very sparingly (like when the baby falls asleep on her so she can watch a show and it doesn't wake him up, etc).  Her birthday is Oct 23. As of today (Feb 8th) the right headphone does not work any longer.  There has been an ongoing issue for 2-3 weeks where the sound would intermittently cut out, but today it stopped working completely.  The return window closed a week ago on Jan 31. If you buy a pair, and both of them continue to work, these are nice headphones (especially for the price), but for whatever reason the right headphone does not work anymore for us."
"May 6, 2021",macker,1.0,11,"Not sure where to start how horrible these are. For one thing, the instrutions say peel off the packing on ear pieces, which mine didnt have. Ok, im willing to overlook that no big deal. They also dont lay right in the charger. Turning them on or off is hit or miss (sometimes turning off one turns off the other, sometimes you need to turn off both individually, half the time when I turn them off they somehow turn back on in the case). Sometimes only 1 charges. MOST ANNOYING even after all that is how it obcessary screams BATTERY LOW, over and over when its not.  Edit: after scream on my ears LOW BATTERY, I charge it but it's 99% . EDIT AGAIN: they broke right after warantee period, nor can I even tell who the seller was/is to contact them. Only one headphone works now. Edit: the support is great from the company itself, I think issue was seller. I'll update more if I actually get a new pair."
"October 1, 2020",Ayotunde Sodipe,5.0,13,"I have used several types of Bluetooth before now and not happy with one thing or the other about them but, now, I am happy with everything about Occiam Bluetooth Headphone. 1. The Bluetooth fits firmly to ears with its strong hanger 2. The Sound quality of the Bluetooth is 100% satisfactory 3. The Noise cancellation of the Bluetooth is 100% satisfactory 4. The Battery life of the Bluetooth is 100% satisfactory 5. The charger case is not too big or bulky to carry around 6. The charger case charges faster than many other Bluetooth I am sure anyone that buys Occiam Bluetooth Headphone would not regret buying it."
"December 21, 2020",CLT,5.0,9,"Ok. I was using a different brand and I've had them for 6 months and now the right ear won't seat in the charging case without me having to jimmy-rig-it with a toothpick. I contacted that seller and they didn't ever get back with me. I would have just ordered another set but I didn't want to spend $65 on an item that only lasted for 6 months! I ordered another brand that had great ratings. Got them. Used them. Hated them. Why? Lemme tell you why I love these: First, longevity of these bluetooth headphones is pretty awesome. I sometimes work a 10 hour or 12 hour shift and I need them to last me that long to get thru it. I take lunch at 6 hours, put them back in their charger box and I'm good to go for the last 4 or 6 hours. Also, the other brand I was using before they stopped charging, had control buttons on each ear piece. You have a volume up and down button on the top of the ear piece itself and then on the side or outward facing part of the ear piece is a button for pause and play. It may have another function but I am unsure. The second set I bought did NOT have these features. You had to hold the outward button down for 2 seconds to increase volume, quick button push to pause/play and what if the volume was too high? I didn't know how to fix that. Second, comfort is also a key element. Everybody has different ears. The first day I wore these my left ear didn't like them too much but I wasn't ready to give up yet. It took me a couple of more days to figure out just how to set them in my ear so they were comfortable. Third, sound quality is pretty great! I don't listen to a  lot of music (yeah I know I'm weird) but I do an awful lot of podcasts and audiobooks and if the ""readers"" sound tinny I don't wanna listen you know? Great balance. I need to be able to hear the low notes or tones and the higher notes sometimes. These are really rounded in sound. I like that. Fourth, cost. $40 was about my price range. I knew I didn't want to spend any less because the quality also goes down with lower prices but I also liked that I didn't have to donate an arm and maybe a leg for these. Fifth, I have yet to use them as a bluetooth connected to my phone for phone calls but I'm sure I'm going to like it a lot. I talk to my parents everyday on the way to work and hands free is essential and EVERYBODY should be hands free but I don't make the laws. My only complaint and it's really quite minor is when I take them out of the case and put them in my ear it takes probably a full 5 to 7 seconds for them to say ""CONNECTED"". One other thing: the earbud tips, they give you 3 different sizes but I prefer the memory foam ones and I have to remove them to get the earbuds back into the charging case. This is the only thing I would change if I could. Just a little more space in the case for different earbud tips. So A+++"
"March 3, 2021","F.R. Southerland, Author",3.0,8,"I absolutely loved these headphones when I first got them. They paired easily, had great sound, cancelled noise. It was incredible. Then, inexplicably, the left side stopped working. I could still change volume and pause videos/music by touching the button, but there was absolutely no sound. I tried syncing it on different devices, resetting the headphones, but all to no avail. Only the right side works. That's fine if I only want to use one earbud on mono for calls or something, but to block out all sound and get the good stereo sound I want--not so much. And, of course, my window to return them closed just a few days prior to them crapping out. Just my luck."
"May 17, 2021",Jason A. Bauzá,2.0,6,"This is my first pair of true wireless ear buds. I was impressed with how well they stayed in my ear during my workouts. The sound quality is good, but not nearly as good as my Sony extra bass wireless headset. I was really enjoying them for the first month. The battery life was great. The sound quality was decent. The best part is that they stayed in my ear even during rigorous workouts like Plyometrics. My Sony wireless headset had better sound quality, but they would not stand my ear during workout. With these earbuds, I could use them even while playing soccer. The issue is that they have a 30-day warranty. On day 38, it fell out of my ear onto the floor. My right earbud broke in half. That your hooks are not replaceable. You have to buy it a whole new set. So, they get two stars because they fit so well and have a great battery life and decent sound. But the plastic that holds everything together is really cheap."
"September 24, 2020",mercedes kotalik,5.0,13,So coworker of mine chomps her gun so loud that I could hear it in my old head phones and needed to have the sound up so high it would give me a headache but I HATE when people eat like they were born in a barn!!! And no matter how many times I asked her to stop she would for a bit then it would sound like a cow eating 🤮 anyway so I got these headphones to see if it would help and these work so good!!! I can have it at a normal sound level and I can't hear my coworker plus it gives me the flexibility to move around with out having to carry my phone!!
"January 14, 2021",Les,5.0,8,"I loved these so much, that after 1 day, of receiving them. I bought a pair for my friend. These are the perfect set for work from home and conference calls that you get on. Since I am a Database Administrator for a health care organization, these are perfect, since I need to type lot in my work. You can also listen to music, without disturbing others. One of the most amazing features it that you can use one or the other and they both have the ability to control your phone. One other feature that is also amazing is, you can use one, while the other is charging, and switch between the two, which doubles your talk time.  It also means that you will always have a fully charged and ready one to use. Lewie"
"October 20, 2020",AmazonFan,5.0,8,"Won't fall out of ear but if wearing a facemask the buds entangle with the mask. Easy to use, just charge up earbud bank and it will charge the buds for one week (I use one ear bud for each use). Battery life is ok, one bud lasts from morning till almost evening with spaced out use. Got into the routine of giving a bud a break and switch out buds mid evening. Sound quality is also ok but not great, if using high volume the music distorts and garbles, but I like a medium low level anyways so its not an issue. I've been able to pair my 2 phones fairly easily with these buds, but sometimes pairing can be stubborn so I just pop em back into the charger bank and start over, usually it corrects this way. Nosie cancellation is great, I was able to hear my music while vacuuming on the highest volume."
"March 18, 2021",Reviewer,1.0,8,"I bought these to replace a similarly priced TBI set I lost. I use these for connecting to my Hydrow row machine for about 30 mins a day. I don't ask for much. These connect to my rower... sometimes.  Both L and R connect... sometimes.  When they work, sound quality is just fine. I missed the return window so throwing in the trash and going back to the TBI brand."
"November 5, 2020",Rodney Jones,5.0,7,Product arrived in nice packaging.  I'll test these out at the gym tomorrow.  Love the look and they feel very comfortable.  Will test the battery life once they are fully charged. UPDATE: Successful time at the gym wearing these.  The sound was really good.  Other buds seem too low in volume.  I never felt like these were coming out of my ear like with other buds...and most importantly the battery lasted through my whole work out.  I had experience with another brand that I had to return because they would die after 45 minutes.  These worked fine the whole time.
"March 7, 2021",S G,1.0,14,"Pros: Decently comfortable Cons: Sounds cuts out A LOT. At least 2-3 times per song, the sound will cut out for a few seconds. Really ruins the purpose if you're trying to get into a jogging rhythm etc. They also don't seem to hold a charge very well, so be prepared to bring a bulky charger with you if you plan to use them a few times during the day. I would return mine, but the ""return window"" was pretty short, so now I'm stuck with them. Not happy."
"February 11, 2021",Tatharnan,1.0,9,"I've had these headphones for about a month now, and they constantly cut in and out. My phone has some bluetooth issues so I gave them the benefit of the doubt until they started cutting out one at a time. One headset would go out, come back, then the other would do the same. I'd recommend buying another brand. I missed the return window on these by a day, it wasn't even a full month since I ordered them, let alone since they arrived. Terrible product."
"November 12, 2020",norse,5.0,7,"UPDATE: After a few months, the left one seems to have a connection issue internally as the sound will cut out if I move the earbud in a certain way. I usually only listen to one side at a time for podcasts and audiobooks, so I will switch to just using the right one now, and will start maybe looking for something that might last a bit longer. ------------------------------------------- I bought these for just keeping handy for doing things around the house, but I've started carrying them with me, and they've come in handy when the stores are already playing INSIPID CHRISTMAS MUSIC already. I like the over-the-ear style. I did not buy them for running, but if my running earbuds fail, I would not hesitate to use these while running, especially seeing as how I can use either of them independently. In fact, that's how I've been using these, mostly, with just one in while listening to podcasts. The sound quality is fine, and no better and no worse than another pair I have (that is not the over-the-ear style and tend to fall out) that cost $80. Some people talk about good or bad ""noise cancelation"" but people say all kinds of things. No earbuds in this price range are going to offer noise cancelation. As for SOUND ISOLATION, these are just fine, with three sizes of SILICONE (not foam) earpieces. And it looks like it's a pretty standard size hub, so you can probably put earpieces from other earbuds on here if none of the three included make you as happy as a clam. Battery life has been good, and the indicator is a pretty slick feature. I dig it."
"February 2, 2021",Alberto B. Padlan,1.0,7,"My wife and I was so excited when I received the product. But after testing it, the sounds was horrible. The volume from my phone and the product was way up already and you still barely hear the conversation. It could be a factory defect. But I decided to return since not much to troubleshoot..That is why I ordered two at the same day from different company for my wife and for me but unfortunately the other product takes a week than the other."
"April 20, 2021",Darrell Spilsbury,1.0,5,"I am a Dr with extensive head and neck anatomy. This thing is designed for some alien or someone who doesn't want the sound to go into their ear canal. All humans have an ear canal that goes upwards and back. This one is designed so it's pointing down and forward. It is the most improperly designed thing I've ever seen.  Consequently the sound has to be at full volume to hear anything and if you are driving, you can't hear anything."
"January 25, 2021",pen💮,5.0,4,"I have had these a few days now, they are quality ear phones. I have had many types of wireless earphones, all have issues, some are not truly wireless, the wire connecting them to earpieces is always causing problems.. truly wireless earbuds I have tried slip and fall out sooner or later.. Most do not have controls like pause, off, or volume control on the earpiece, requiring one to take the source device out.. to adjust sound or pause These, and are truly wireless. They do not move or fall out, they are completely secure and comfortable on the ear. Each earpiece has all the controls, as you can use them individually. My ears are super sensitive, as is my hearing.  These are comfortable and have 3 sizes of earpieces.  The sound is amazing, crisp, clear, and very good for the price. These are a quality product, and sync together immediately. I have other more expensive earbuds that will not sync together ever, it is very frustrating, since their sound is optimal, I can only use them mono, one at a time.  They  also start slipping fall out after 45 minutes. I have other earphones with a secure over the ear wire, as these do, but the wire always moves and is too long, which hurts and irritates  the back of the ear after 60 minutes.. These are very good so far.. I hope they continue to keep this standard as time goes on."
"November 14, 2020",fatimaluis,5.0,6,"Just got these and I'm impressed. I spent quite some time researching different wireless headphones and earbuds before I came across these. I love that these are completely wireless but still go over the ear for a more secure fit. They're comfortable for my ears as well which is absolutely fantastic. Other earbuds I've tried (more mainstream brands such as skullcandy and other ones) always fit ok at first but within an hour or sometime less my ears are in pain. The noise reduction is spot on for both ends. I like to play my music loud enough to block out most sounds but usually that means others around me can hear the beat of my music or something of the sort. With these not only do I not need to have the music very loud to cancel out noises going on around me, no one else hears my music! Fantastic! I dont know about any one else but that is something that would drive me insane way too often. Battery life is solid and I like that you can see how much battery life is left for each earbud. Sometimes I like to only have one earbud in so I can have a conversation with someone at the same time while doing a task."
"April 2, 2021",Phill.The.Thrill,4.0,3,"After my iJoy headphones started falling apart during my gym workouts, I decided to try these Occiam Bluetooth Headphones-True Wireless Earbuds. I was a little hesitant to buy these headphones due to some of the other reviews but in my experience, these are really good headphones. They fit around my ears and inside nicely. They connect to my iPhone 6 easily but I did notice that they sometimes tend to pair with my phone while still in their charging case which should keep them ""OFF"". I also noticed that if I had my iPhone in my pocket while running, the sound cut in and out. Oddly enough, carrying my phone in my hand while running at the same exact speed eliminated the problem. That's not a big deal but just kind of weird to me. All in all, I'd suggest trying these headphones out if you need so nice, inexpensive earbuds you can use while working out, hanging out, or wondering about."
"February 2, 2021",nick backaus,1.0,13,"First, I was quite happy with the product. They were generally comfortable and battery life was quite comfortable. My early gripes are just small picky things. The first is requiring the home dock to resync a connection. If I turn off the Bluetooth to share a video or something, I would have to place the headpiece back into the dock to resync and turn it back on. Honestly, not that big of a deal just though I might note it for future purchasers. The second minor gripe is it makes a high pitched ringing while charging sometimes. Again, very minor problem. Now we are just shy of two months and I am down to only one working side. I want to like this product, but the fact that one side has already quit working leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
"March 10, 2021",jose f.,4.0,2,Well im giving it only 4 stars because even so this earbuds are good what im disappointed 😥.. About is that when I be having both on connected to my Bluetooth on my cell phone the minute I start listening to music it starts to go in and out every time and that's bad especially when they do sound good the base is pretty decent and it's there the battery life is good as well and on phone calls it works awesome and that's where it really bugles me when I use just use one as for phone calls or music it works really well and that is where im disappointed in because the minute I use both that's when it starts to go in and out every time but if I use only one it works good especially on phone calls yeah I could had returned them but since they work really great on phone calls I decided to keep them for only that and I went and got a different pair of earbuds for my music 🎶..... And as for hearing the background as you listening to music it's pretty good but when it comes to really loud sounds like a bus or even a motorcycle you can hear it so im a bit disappointed with this and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone unless I just happen to get a bad batch who knows.
"January 20, 2021",charlie1231,4.0,3,"Just got it.  easy to pair, only tested for music, which is my main purpose.  Nice balanced warm sound, bass could be heard at 40Hz at median level.  High frequency is heard up to about15k Hz, stopped suddenly at above frequency.  Tested another earbud, same scenario, sudden sound die-off above 15K Hz.  Perhaps my hearing capability?  Two drives are balanced well.  Listened a few 8D music, very locational.  The hook is soft so there is no stress around the ears, 5 hrs on I didn't feel a thing.  Didn't test for call and waterproof.  BTW, this earbud is the pick after two returns of other brands (not the hook type).  Overall, I do recommend it. Used for 40 days.  Two cons: 1) after the earbud powered off, when turn back on, the connection between the earbud and my PC can not be automatically resumed somehow.  I had to re-initiate by turning the bluetooth off and then on to make the connection. 2) The case is not easy to open because the dent area at the opening spot is too small, thumb is hard to fit int.  quite annoying.  also the two earbud store position in the case, left and right, actually meaning right and left is confusing, not intuitive.  Drop rating from 5 to 4."
"January 26, 2021",Ashleigh M,5.0,3,"Like a lot of folks these days, I have many, many electronic devices - cell phone, Kindles, laptops (yeah, plurals on more than one of those things). I got tired of trying to keep track of my wired headsets, and switched to Bluetooth some time back. I bought two sets of these earbuds, paird one with my Laptop, and the other with my Kindle, since I listen to both music and audiobooks on it. This past weekend, I needed a set of earbuds for another tablet, but didn't want to have to go through the whole pairing process, and instead managed to find an old wired set. That was fine, until I needed to get up and do something, and nearly pulled the tablet off of the desk where I was working. These have good, decent sound (I'm hard of hearing to begin with) and they make a great difference in me being able to hear clearly enough to understand what is being said. I only wish my regular hearing aids worked this well! I just bought two more pair of them for another e-reader (Nook) and that aforementioned tablet (Surface Pro)."
"November 29, 2020",Noe,4.0,5,I just got this product yesterday. The shipping was great timing. I charged them but they keep saying 78% charged even though I left them 2 hours. I will leave them over night to charge se of that changes. But I did try them. Connected easy to portable MP3 player and sounds great. I said I would buy again but no I wouldn’t. Sound is great and connect easy to device but don’t charge completely. Charged overnight and only said 68%. They are comfortable and stay secure.
"February 3, 2021",Christi Simmons,1.0,25,"Just received Occiam headphones.  Packaging was new and as expected.  I just started charging them, so I'll add to this review in a little while after using them.  But so far, so good! **UPDATE** Charge was fast and started using headphones yesterday; and they are really good!  I like them a lot.  A little low on the bass, but the clarity is fantastic.  I have Samsung earbuds, but they don't always stay in when moving around - my ears are small so none of the bud really work.  These stay perfectly over my ear and don't move. The fit is great because you don't feel them after a while.  I'm a developer on the computer all day long.  These headphones work great - especially for the price.  They look good too, because they're vertical, not horizontally sticking out.  Really good design.  For the price these are going to be hard to beat!! **ANOTHER UPDATE** The bass actually is really good now.  I had to adjust my equalizer on Music Bee to 10 band, then added the Pre-Amp!! Now it's excellent.  I'm really impressed.  See ya. *** FINAL UPDATE !!!*** Well... I thought these might work, but today they COMPLETELY STOPPED WORKING!  I've had them for a month or so, but now I'll need to search for another pair.  Based on this I would not buy again! They started going off and disconnecting intermittently, then suddenly totally shut off, even after charging them."
"February 20, 2021",DoctorMom,5.0,2,"The most comfortable earbuds ever. I mean really really comfortable. Stay in place. That's been a problem for me in past. Sound is great. Would buy again in a heartbeat. ~ 2 mo update UPDATE: I use these daily sound quality is great but the charger case stopped working. It uses a USB to c-charger cord, and it's cheap looking and very short. I didn't have another one to check out if it was a cord or a case problem. I contacted seller by email as outside the return window, but under warranty. They responded promptly and sent an entirely new replacement (earbuds, base and cord, within a week!  While unplugging my old case the cord tip fell apart so that was clearly the problem.  I bought a separate sturdier cord to use moving forward. They should improve the quality of the charger cord, but can't complain given above service."
"June 18, 2021",Kim,1.0,One,"The reviews on here are surprising. I had this device for a few months. Four issues occurred between the time I brought them up until now. First issue is the design of the charging case. It is very slippery and flimsy. I dropped it once while placing the charger cord in the port. As soon as it hit the ground the lid broke off. Second issue, a month later people were having trouble hearing me through the set (so I can no longer use it for hands free calling). Thirdly, the bluetooth connectivity begin to disconnect without any interference or distance between the earpiece and the phone.  To reconnect it was an ongoing battle of multiple means of troubleshooting the device. Fourth issue, ongoing troubleshooting which involved turning the earpiece off and then back on; returning it to the charging case and then placing it back on my ear; erasing the connection from my phone and then reconnecting. Lastly, the time it takes to connect has increased from a few seconds to two or three minutes. I used this device everyday for answering calls. I wear them when I run twice a week. I listening to music and watching videos with this device. (Things you expect to do with the device) So, my use of this headset is on the heavy side. Heavy use could be the reason for the increasing issues Ive experienced these past few months. On the plus side, The sound quality is still great (on my end) but that may be the next thing to go base on the quility decline of this earpiece. I don't recommend this product for heavy use."
"January 22, 2021",Maggie,5.0,4,"I bought and tried more than 4 wireless earbuds from Amazon. Nothing fits my ears perfectly. All of them fell off while I was on the phone and hurt my ears so much after wearing them more than 1 hour. This is the first time that the earbuds did not fall off. Even I shake head, run, jump...whatever I do, they just fit my ears!!! Not only how it fits but also..... the sound!!! OMG....sooooo gooood! I own Beat headphone and literally, these little ones beat the Beat!!! Bass is good and also a high sound range is good. Call quality is very good, too. My husband could not tell I was talking using the earbuds. He said that it is so clear. I don't use noise-cancelling feature, but I tried. I did not hear my son's playing Minecraft. It was actually great that I don't hear him building blocks' sound lol I definitely recommend to everyone who has difficulty to wear earbuds. Great sound, so comfortable, and in terms of the price, nothing beats these earbuds!!!"
"July 2, 2021",Willy P.,1.0,One,"I am a painter and I spend at least 8 plus hours with my headphones in, therefore I need something that can hang with my life. I had found a pair that I enjoyed and were much cheaper in price than these, but I decided to venture and try something new. So here I am...writing a review, I normal carry on with life and cut my loses but I felt like sharing my joureny. Got my first pair, had to ask for an exchange. Why? Because the right ear piece kept pushing my ear out and it did not sit well in my ear. Secondly, I sweat a lot because of paint heat (chemicals) and my paint suit, and they kept falling out because of my sweaty ears (my other ones did not fall off as much) and I would have to stop what I am doing to fix my problem, Thridly, because I sweat a lot, the charging three holes on the headphones are now getting oxidize and its not properly charging. Overall, the sound was good but it sucked becasue I always had to keep pushing them in order to block out outside noise. As for the product, I will not buy these ever again. I guess I am the only one with problems since they have ""good"" ratings."
"December 16, 2020",Cherie Perry,5.0,3,"Well, I finally got tired of wired earbuds especially as I started piling on the winter layers, I tried a few pairs of wireless, one of them was poor sound quality and static so I wasn't too bummed when it easily fell out of my ear for the 30th or so time and got lost, the second sounded ok but also easily fell out. I got these a a backup to try a different brand because I knew the 2nd pair would soon follow the fate of the first. I love the Occiam, the sound quality is exceptional for music and passed my elderly moms hearing issues, they are very comfortable ( so much so that I fell asleep in one once, thought I'd lost another and then found it in my pillows! ) They really hug your ear and I am confident that I will not lose this pair, but if I do I will replace with another of this brand! Highly recommend and great value..."
"April 11, 2021",H. Smith,3.0,One,First things first I reviewed this product before purchasing. As I live in the Caribbean and I had it shipped a Florida address for onward shipping to me. I paid 31 + USD for the item and I chose free shipping. I was delivered on time at the Florida address.  However when I finally recieved the product  it came in a box about 12 times the size of the box housing the earphones. I was exicited because my ear pods  would fall out when removing my face mask so I decided to purchase one that has a hook over the ear. The product looked great  but when I put them on the felt good  the problem came when I tried to adjust the volume on the volume button the earphones. It went up but refused to go down again. I tried both sides only the left works. So now I'm stuck with using my phone for adjust the volume up and down. That's disappointing  cause if I'm driving I don't want to be using my phone in my hand. As alaw enforcement official I must set the example.  I contacted Amazon but they said I must return it to ups It has already cost me 31 usd  plus 21usd to ship to the Caribbean and clear customs. A total of 52+ usd. To return from th Caribbean I have to pay and when it return I must clear it again.  I disappointed that I got a broken product and replaced it will cost more than twice the original. Amazon please do better cause we the customers want to continue to do business and not feel cheated out of our hard earned money.
"September 5, 2020",Richard,1.0,13,"These are awesome! I haven’t had good luck with ear buds. So I was going to spend more money on a set. Saw all the reviews and decided to give it a try. These work fantastically and they actually stay in place as well. What a great deal, you won’t be sorry! UPDATE: After using for 4 months and not daily, the left ear unit stopped functioning. It will work occasionally, but then shuts off. Beware! You maybe sorry"
"February 10, 2021",Joel K.,1.0,3,"These are the most frustrating ear bubs. The first set didn't hold a charge. The replacement ones worked for awhile, then would not connect to my phone. Tried for an hour then gave up. Amazon was also worthless. Made me drive miles to a Kohl's store, spend my own money on gas, and make me risk my safety by going into a store during a pandemic just to return them. I WOULD NOT recommend these unless you want to pull your hair out with frustration. Amazon didn't help either."
"February 20, 2021",Danielle P.,5.0,2,"I bought these mostly because they have the piece that curves over the back of your ear; I was sick of earbuds that just stuck in & you hoped they never fell out (or you’re forever adjusting them to stay in). For the price, I’m really impressed with the quality. The sound is crystal clear & they’re comfortable enough to wear through an hour-long workout. With other earbuds (specifically noise-canceling ones), I would always be annoyed by that deep thumping noise you’d hear around them (I’m sorry I can’t find a better way to describe this); this was so distracting while I would be in the middle of cardio. These earbuds don’t seem to have that issue as much. At least, it’s not enough to bother me anymore. Battery life is great. No complaints there. My only qualm is that you use one earpiece to raise the volume on your device, and the other to lower it. I wish I could just use one or the other to do both. A small inconvenience, but not enough to take away a full star."
"December 7, 2020",Tufqifo,4.0,4,"Overall, these are nice and have 3 sizes of ear inserts included. They're awkward to put on, but secure. Sound quality: so-so. Cuts out under pressure (e.g. doesn't work well with balaclava/ski mask) Battery life: about the same in use or not (~8 hrs) Case: pocket-safe, but lid pops off easily when open Comfort: you feel them, but not bad for a few hours"
"May 13, 2021",Pirate Penguin,3.0,One,"Pros: - Stay on ears better than buds without ear hooks. - Easy to connect to phone. - Great battery life. I listen multiple hours per day and really only need to charge the case maybe once per week. - Small enough to carry around easily in a pocket, etc. Cons: - Connection will randomly disconnect briefly while using, so the sound is inconsistent between the ears (and it alternates, so it isn't just one bad bud, it's both and the connectivity). It isn't all the time, it isn't every day or every use, but often enough to be annoying. - Case is a little fragile - broke easily with a small drop so now I have it taped together at the back hinge. - The buds go into the case opposite of the ear they go on - the left ear bud fits into the right side of the case and vice versa - totally an OCD issue, but you do have to cross them when taking them out or putting them back in vs the ear you wear them on. A minor annoyance, but it does irk me a little. :)"
"April 8, 2021",Tim in Texas,3.0,One,"Great for the price! I bought these to use when jogging and biking because they are more secure than the standard earbuds. However, the case is made of hard plastic that feels slightly cheap, but not a deal breaker. The blue tooth is easy to pair and ready to use. There are volume controls on each bud to accommodate a left or right handed person which at times can be hit or miss. I prefer using the phone's volume control. *Update 4.30.2021. Neither volume control works any longer. You must use the volume control on your phone which can be a hassle when you’re riding a bike, etc.  so I am changing 4 stars to 3 When it comes to sound performance,  I would say for the average person, these are ideal. Nice bass! For the sound aficionado, on a scale from 1 to 10, It would be a strong 7 (weak 8) for the lack of true High Definition music resolution. As for call quality, I'd give this a 6+ per several people I spoke to said they could hear an echo when speaking; although I heard them perfectly fine. Overall, I  purchased these for fitness, and not for conversation, so they are perfect for the job, and would definitely recommend!"
"January 3, 2021",Crea19,5.0,3,"They are loud enough I can ignore people or just zone out. They don't fall off which was a big thing. I don't like headphones because they either fall out or the big ones hurt my ears. They work with my very picky Bluetooth music player. Also, these bad boys survived an accidental excursion through my washing machine AND dryer. I love these. EDIT 1/10/21: I did notice that a lot of people were commenting on the charging device holding a charge. I will say this is does die after a while--mine in particular, I noticed it does hold a charge up to about 1-2 days before hitting zero if not using it. If use after charging obviously that'll deplete it if I don't charge it again."
"January 15, 2021",kbat,5.0,2,"If you're looking for decent wireless ear buds on a budget these are a great option.  The sound quality doesn't match say, Bose or Sennheiser, but neither does the price.  They sound good though and are easy to wear.  You won't forget that you're wearing them but you won't be uncomfortable either.  The tips are soft and the ear loop is low profile so you can wear them for extended periods without wanting to rip them out. My husband has a comparable pair of Vislla ear buds at the same price and nearly identical design, also with good sound.  Compared to these, Visllas are heavier on the bass and these Occiams have more emphasis on midrange / vocals (which I like). The case charging display is helpful and the size fits nicely in a pocket.  It's a little odd that when you open the case the right ear bud is on the left and vice versa, but no big deal.  Battery life is great.  I like the separate volume buttons on the top of each ear bud and that either one can be the master.  Pairing is simple and after the initial scan, the process is automatic--it happens when you remove them from the case."
"November 18, 2020",Kurtis,5.0,4,"These are the first pair of earbuds (after trying on quite a few) that actually stay on my ear the whole time while running. Most ear hooks I have found, are either way too ridged or like a ""wet noodle"" as others have said. These are a perfect in-between to me. They even stay on while I take my mask on and off. I have had some trouble with the volume working consistently but the sound quality is great, the range is great, and they are very comfortable. I have had to contact the company and they were quick to respond and very helpful."
"October 29, 2020",Lizzy Collette,5.0,3,The size of the ear phones are great.  I can never get ear buds to stay in so I especially love the added security of over the ear feature.  I just received them so I haven't really got any miles on them but they look like the quality is good.  I will have to leave an update after using them for a period of time.  The earbuds have wireless charging which is a huge added feature. I'm pretty confident I wont lose these bad boys. The only negative I see so far is you have to leave a review in order to claim the free earbuds offered as a prize.  Kinda hard without getting to use these first.  They do look promising though.  Will update if they wind up sucking
"February 13, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,2,"I got these earbuds a little while back, and they've been pretty great!  Long battery life, good sound quality, good fit.  But recently I've noticed that the charge on my case has been slowly ticking down.  I have realized that I am unable to charge the case for some reason.  It isn't the wire- I've tried multiple different wires, including the one I use to charge my phone.  All of the wires work fine, but the case does not gain any charge.  It's currently at 18% now, and I'm already starting to mourn this pair- they've been pretty good.  I'm also impressed at how long the case lasted without a charge.  When it finally dies, maybe I'll cut it open to see if there's anything visibly broken on the inside."
"April 27, 2021",Elizabeth,1.0,3,"I couldn't listen to a whole song without it losing connection. It worked good for a day or 2 but that was it, after that it was useless for me. I put in a review after this happened and I got an email stating that I would be refunded if I took my poor review down. I did and I never received any emails stating a refund was going to be made and never got the refund. $40 dollars isn't a lot of money for ear buds, so I wasn't demanding amazing quality. But at least to be able to connect to my phone and work in close range is the bare minimum so I was unhappy."
"June 9, 2021",DEP,1.0,,"I waited a few weeks before writing a review to make sure I used them enough to be able to provide proper feedback. I usually go running for 3-4 hours and at first, I really enjoyed these. Their bass was rich and deep, the audio clarity was pretty good considering the price these cost, everything was good. Then one day, the right side just randomly shut off and wouldn't turn on. I thought it died and just kept running with the left side playing music. After about 45 minutes, the right side powered on and began playing music again. I wrote it off and thought nothing of it. Then I noticed every time I put these headphones in their case that should show the charging levels for each side began to only show the charging level for the left side. Then I noticed that when I put them in the case to charge, the number would decrease daily. So after running, I would put them in the case and it would say 96. The following day it would say 96 as well, I would go running, put them in the case and the following day it would say 92. It's like they weren't being charged properly or the charging display didn't show properly, I can't tell. Then I noticed that the right side would cut off completely when I turned my head to the left sometimes. This reminded me of the older generation bluetooth headphones that used to cut out like this when I turned my head in certain directions. Then today, the left side would cut out and sound like the music was coming from a scratched CD on a CD player. Constantly cutting out and sometimes completely going silent for a while before randomly playing again but still cutting out frequently. Then the right side would do it and they would alternate doing this for hours. I'm done with these, they are absolute junk. This is like the 6th pair of headphones I've gotten from Amazon for under $50 and they all usually don't last more than few weeks or a few months. These only lasted me around 2 weeks which is disappointing to say the least."
"June 23, 2021",Moro,5.0,,"So I won't lie, I bought these as a cheap replacement for a pair of headphones that I got as a gift a few years ago. I was thinking 'I'll get something else later, I just need something for now'. So I picked these out and I waited for mine to come in. I was INCREDIBLY surprised. They come in a case that is a little big bigger than the ones I had before. What's nice though is that it feels sturdy and not like it's gonna fly open at the slightest provocation. The display though when I first plugged it in! It is so bright and easy to read and then being able to see what the charge is on either side of my headphones was a friggin dream! It was one of the things I really was going crazy with on my last pair so being able to tell that they were in and charging was a beautiful thing. To pair them to my computer was...really easy and I was surprised by just how simple it was. I've gotten so used to having to fight with my headphones to connect that I forgot it was supposed to be easy. Putting them on was actually very comfortable. I didn't have to switch out the bits to make them fit my ears and they rest really comfortably around my ears themselves. I feel like I can shake and move my head around and they're not going to pop out; this is especially important to me since I'm both clumsy and active. Finally: Do they work well? The sound is impressive for a pair in this price range. They cut outside noise very well; I didn't realize my roommate was talking to me until I turned the sound down almost to nothing. The quality of the sound is actually quite decent; while better can be found in other products, for the price this is above tier. Are they worth the buy? ABSOLUTELY. Right now, the only possible downside has been some of the spelling errors on the packaging and those aren't really a downside but rather amusing. While I need to see how long they last altogether, if they last a decent amount of time with no issue, I might need to rethink my original plan of buying a different set."
"May 5, 2021",Roger,2.0,One,"First item received was DOA, showed no signs of life when charged for several hours. When I received a replacement it was apparent the first item was not new and had been returned by someone else: shrink wrap missing, wire around charging cable missing, insulator film on earbud contacts missing. My intended use of the earbuds was to replace a set of headphones used by my hard of hearing spouse to watch TV. My current setup includes an Avantree bluetooth transmitter and Avantree headphones. These work well, but the headphones become warm and uncomfortable after an hour or two. The problem with the Occiam earbuds is they introduce a slight delay in the sound. So when the TV speakers are playing (for me) and my spouse is using the earbuds there is a jumbled sound that is not present with the Avantree headphones."
"December 10, 2020",JK,1.0,7,"I was never able to get R earbuds to turn on. Ensured proper battery charge twice. Tried turning on using both the auto on feature when removed from case and manual switch. Neither worked. Also, admittedly only one earbud worked (left), but overall tonal quality was mediocre at best . Bass response was sub par even though on line description advertised deep bass response."
"February 23, 2021",Jem,2.0,3,"I really wanted to like these, but I just can't.  Maybe I received a defective pair, but these are probably the worst Bluetooth earbuds I've ever bought.  The sound cuts off constantly.  I used them on my walks in the morning and about once every 2 mins the sound would just stop for a second or two.  It also stops every single time I turn my head or touch my phone.  They act like they are the plug in earbuds and the plug isn't pushed in all the way.  It is really annoying.  I used them for over a week hoping that maybe it would work itself out, but it hasn't and I don't want to miss my return window.  Sending them back."
"June 26, 2021",Ryan P. OConnor,3.0,,"I was trying to find a good pair of over the ear loop / sport ear buds.  This set was pretty high on amazon's list and the price is cheap.  I sent them back.  If you have nothing, they're not the worst.  Fit in my ear and felt super secure (and no, not too tight in the ear or uncomfortable or anything).  They do sit pretty deep in your ear though, and that's part of the issue.  Sound is good, comparable to my current JLabs executive whatevers (the sort of step up from the bottom of jlabs earbuds).  The problem is when you need to adjust anything or use the buttons for answering a call or changing music tracks.  The volume rockers being on both ears is nice but seems like a waste of space that other functions could be added to.  They stick out enough that they're easily found and used.  The big beef (and why I ultimately returned them) was the side buttons.  Again, easily found by touch but require some force to press/click which drives the ear buds deeper into your ears and is pretty uncomfortable and not something I wanted to deal with on an ongoing basis.  This is where JLabs (and probably others) win- just light taps on the sides of the earbuds for answering, volume, track changes, equalizer presets, etc.  No excessive pressure.  Add this type of function (and the jlabs app where you get a FULL equalizer to play with!) and you'd have a much more superior product.  I went with the Jlabs sport version and will put them through some testing a write a review for them as well.  Early results though - twice the price (or more) as Occiam here, but just as good as the other jlabs I have with the added ear loops / hooks although they don't feel as secure as the Occiams did, but no amount of shaking my head through them loose or out.  Equalizer in the app was a great addition and wireless charging for the case is good feature as well."
"December 25, 2020",Eric and Katie,5.0,3,"Pairing was easy, sound is amazing, fit is superior to any other headphones I've owned. I've owned earbud style headphones including $200 Bose that are too heavy & fall out, over- the-ear headphones that can get sweaty, around-your-neck styles that fall out or get in the way, and wired ear-hook styles like these (which I think fit best). These offer the best of everything - fit, weight, sound, and let me say this about noise cancelation: even at a moderate volume, I can't hear a word anyone is saying, even right next to me. To say that I'm impressed is an understatement."
"July 3, 2021",Melissa Lara,1.0,4,"Product broke in a week, the company would not replace or refund the money. So I left a bad review then they (three different people) emailed me over and over asking me to remove the comment. So we both agreed on a solution (took 1-2 months long). Then the company never followed through with the solution we both agreed on. Horrible customer service and company, they do not follow through with what they say they will just waste months of your time on a CHEAP QUALITY PRODUCT. SPEND YOUR MONEY AT A COMPANY THAT CARES AND BACKUPS THEIR PRODUCTS!!!"
"March 2, 2021",Bryan,2.0,One,"Bit surprised by the 4.5 stars despite how many have rated the product. Product looks great all the way around and certain does what it advertises. Wasn’t looking to be blown away or am I in any way an audiophile, but it underperforms against my other generic $35-40 wireless ear pod style headphones. Clarity, crispness, bass, and max output is a noticeable drop even for this novices ear. Where it also underperforms is the mic. Called several friends to test it out vs. my older model and each friend says I sound distant or muffled on this one. Can’t swap older one for this one because of lower quality performance where it matters, despite its convenience and appearance. Probably will just bite the bullet and spring for a quality one. At least those can retain some value and definitely will get the mileage and without thinking if I should upgrade again anytime soon."
"October 21, 2020",Will N,5.0,4,"I bought these earbuds to replace my broken ones and very happy with these. They fit well and comfortable. Battery life is great. Overall, it's a solid set for the price. Couple possible improvements: I wish they come with additional sizes of the silicone hooks to fit younger people with smaller ears. Also, a clear lid on top would help seeing the charging LED without opening the box."
"January 19, 2021",Erik Varney,1.0,3,"I really wanted these headphones to work reliably.  My first pair had disconnect issues on the right headphone intermittently, then the case pins broke out for the right headset a week later, making it not able to charge. I got a replacement unit shipped out in three days, and while this one did not ""break"", I have constant connection loss on only the right headset when my device is only 3 feet away, which was exactly what was happening with the first pair. Unless Occiam can fix their quality control issues, I would say this is not a headset you want to invest in."
"May 15, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"I purchased these 6 months ago. I used them mainly for my runs (3-5 miles at a time). I love  that you can see where they are at battery wise. The case has a battery that charges them as soon as you put them away so they should always be charged. However, they automatically turn on when taken out of the case. I found that if the case got bumped and the earphones shifted they automatically turn on and the battery runs out. They also connected easily which is great when trying to get out quickly but awful when you are talking on the phone and the earbuds decided to connect because someone opened the drawer where they are stored. After 4 months they started having challenges getting both earphones to connect at the same time. They are fully charged and are on but only one would connect to the phone. Then the other would connect and disconnect at 5 second intervals. 6 months in and I can't get the left earphone to turn on at all. They just don't last long enough to make them worth the price. The fit was ok, nothing special but not bad either."
"January 13, 2021",Fnsze,4.0,2,My son needed new ear buds and wanted these after reading the reviews and researching different ones. They definitely cancel noise cause he can’t hear us calling him when he has them in! When he’s in his moods you can hear the music across the room word for word! Battery life could be better but they last him 48 hrs then he has to charge them now that he’s back in school and can’t use them all day. When used all day he has to charge them that night. He’s very happy with them
"April 2, 2021",G T & L S,5.0,,"I love these.  I listen to audiobooks and videos while keeping house. 1.  You can use these one at a time.  Pair them. Place one back into the charging box.  Enjoy. 2.  The battery is amazing.  Seriously, it’s amazing.  Using them one at a time I always have it available.  I had to be up for 36 hrs recently.  They were in use the whole time. 3. These will fit securely in your ears even if you have small ears like I do. 4. The range is really good.  Every other Bluetooth headset and earbud I have purchased cut out if I didn’t carry my iPad into each room with me.  I can now leave it charging and go about my household chores and child chasing. I haven’t bought anything I loved this much in years. These were originally bought for my husband.  He liked all of these features.  He thought the problem he had with them came from the noise canceling.  He said, “Whenever I took a phone call it always quieted down.”  So much so, he had a difficult time hearing the call. I don’t know if it’s just this set or not.  I don’t use these for my phone so they’re still perfect for me."
"November 27, 2020",Abelaei2,4.0,2,"Over all great bluetooth ear set.  i use them for my workouts, they stay in place for the most part.  changed out the ear inserts to get a tighter fit.  it helped.  but i did notice when i'm sweating like crazy and i move the ear piece, the ear piece will shut off and then say turning on.  so, i've gotten to where i'm wiping sweat off the front of my ears an wiping down the charging connections on the ear pieces.  a small hassle.  if they wouldn't reset, they would be perfect."
"April 8, 2021",Christy,2.0,One,"1st pair volume buttons didn't work but I loved everything else about these so I returned and got a replacement pair. 2nd pair, Same issues with the volume control not connecting consistently and the bluetooth connection also cut out on this pair sometimes.  Returned them. I really wanted to like these.  Lots of great reviews from others but it didn't work out.  They have great sound quality and great battery life on the buds and the case.  Noise cancelation was good enough for me.  I could still hear my kids enough to know what was happening but it didn't make me loose focus on what I was listening to.  Very comfortable fit, lightweight."
"June 21, 2021",Darius,2.0,,"I bought these headphones due to the large number of positive reviews, with that being said unfortunately the highs lasted for a short time. Pros: - mono ability - decent sound quality - digital display of charge case battery levels - comfortable for long wear - stays in place while exercising Cons - low volume, even at max volume these are fairly low. great if you want to protect your ears...but would be nice for them to be louder - case quality feels cheap. Feels as if it would not provide the necessary protection and i suppose this would hold true as detailed below - poor headphone quality. I have had these headphones since Apr 13, 2021 (so nearly 2 months) and the right earbud is already cutting out. There has been moments that a simple touch cause the right bud to distort, this will be accompanied by sudden disconnects where i will have to put the ear piece back into the case. This would help reconnect but the distort on touch still remains to the point i don't even use it anymore. - Case magnet are also fairly week. within the two months of ownership i have noticed the earbuds connecting to my device while in its case. this means the magnet is weak to where even with the case close, they come out slightly and just enough that they turn on and connect, but then the magnet will grab them again thus turning them off. Perhaps I received a bad pair, but i am quite disappointed to have ran into these issues after just 2 months of owner ship."
"September 18, 2020",junglestrut24,5.0,3,I've been looking for a headset that replaces my bulky and heavy Plantronics Voyager. It's been quite a search but I think I have the closest one yet. What I really like about this pair is how clear the sound is. Both in the sound that I hear and from the volume of what the person I speaking with is hearing. It does the job and I like it. One thing that I wish the headset will have is slightly more bass and definition but other than that it provides adequate sound and signal. I am completely satisfied.
"May 12, 2021",Al P,5.0,One,"They offer you a free lifetime warranty or a random new pair of earbuds if you “activate” the warranty or whatever. When you scan the code, it takes you to a website where you choose your prize and submit your email address. Afterwards, they tell you that in order to obtain the lifetime warranty or free earbuds, you will have to submit a five star review. I am giving them five stars, but only because I want the lifetime warranty.  As for the actual product, the sound quality, Bluetooth pairing and charging are all great. They aren’t very loud, especially for in ear headphones, and although there is an ear clip, I wouldn’t wear them for exercise, because they are fairly loose."
"June 30, 2021",RG,4.0,,"Nice noise canceling, solid as a rock Bluetooth, and a really nice carry case.  I also like they way that they feel on my ears, very solid and doesn't move or slip out.  Sound quality leaves something to be desired, although you should keep in mind that is a very personal choice.  For those of you who are in the know, the way I'd describe these is ""scooped"".  In other words, in a standard EQ range, the mid ranges are de-emphasized for in favor of the low (or sometimes high) ranges so the the EQU range looks like it's been scooped out.  I don't generally have a problem with this for certain kinds of music, but it can get a little annoying at times.  Podcasts/spoken word doesn't need booming bass, and vocal ranges usually live in the center range so you're dulling it.  Most American ears probably won't even notice since everything these days is heavy bass, but it bothers me.  I'm not looking for reference EQ, but the emphasis on the lower ranges is enough to bother me.  Still, I'll keep these.  They're good enough."
"March 18, 2021",David R.,4.0,,"At first, I wasn't too impressed with the sound quality, but after some fitment adjustments, the quality is really good. If you don't have a good fit in your ear canal, the bass seems to get lost. This is easily fixed with proper fitment. They connect to each other quickly once removed from the charging case, and will automatically connect to the last device they were connected to.  The charging case is pretty cool, as once you put the headphones into it, they disconnect from your device and start charging automatically. However, I could see this being bad for the battery life if you're only wearing them for a short amount of time and then putting them back into the case. I've gotten into the habit of just turning them off when I'm not using them, and wont put them back into the case until they have reached low battery. One gripe I have is that each ear bud needs to be turned off and on separately. (but this is only if you're not keeping them in the case when not in use, so I kind of understand it)"
"December 22, 2020",Nancy Robinson,3.0,4,Batteries die after charging and not in use. I have to charge them immediately prior use every time even though I fully charge them when i'm finished using them
"April 2, 2021",CL Phoenix,5.0,,"I love these!! The case is sturdy and cute. It shows the percentage digitally so you know how much longer you have.  You can use one or both at a time, the sound is crisp and amazing, bass is pretty great as well. The noise cancelling is seriously great and it charges really well and fast. Also, one of the biggest pluses to me is how fast it connects to the bluetooth in my phone. My old pair had to search and it was odd, but these immediately work. Best purchase I've made in a while! My old earbuds died and I was really upset because they were the only ones I'd ever had that didn't hurt my ears... until these! Yay! They are SO comfy that I forgot they were in when I had the music paused to answer a call at work. And when in, I cant hear any nonsense around me! These things save lives because, lets face it, some coworkers deserve to be punched in the throat for their behavior. Thanks for helping me keep my job and not go to jail. lol :)"
"July 9, 2021",K. Langolf,4.0,One,"The case is slippery but sturdy.  I have dropped it 4 times within a week and it hasn't dented. The product did fall out after pact which made me worry. The ear pieces are more delicate, but seem to be undamaged. They work fine and fit over my ears. The mic is so-so as others have said it is hard to hear me speak. It paired easily and connects each time I take them out of the charging case. Used for 2 hours without issue. Supposed to last 8 hours without charging. To solve the slippery case, I put metallic paint on it to allow for better grip."
"March 14, 2021",Bob G,3.0,One,"I picked these up to use while cutting the grass as standard ear buds tend to fall out when active. The good news is they are very comfortable to wear and gave a nice informative case. The sound is crisp and clean , the bass is below average but the voice clarity at this price is very very good. The bad news for me making them not useful as intended is they are just not load enough to hear while working like cutting grass . Yes trying to push to the limits but if my buds from another brand are loud enough then these should have been too. If your in quiet areas of use then I recommend them. If your not you may struggle"
"July 9, 2021",JM85,5.0,,"I've had these for less than 24 hours and I'm already in love. They are so comfortable in my ear, I can hardly feel them, and they are so secure. My Beats by Dre headphones were CONSTANTLY falling out of my ears at the gym, but these are completely secure. They paired with my iPhone seamlessly, and switching between using just 1 or both is also seamless. The sound quality is excellent and they block outside noise completely. Minor complaints: 1) they don't get quiet enough. Sitting in my quiet house with the volume on the lowest setting, they're still a bit too loud. What's nice is I can pull them out of my ear but still keep them ON my ear, and then it's not as loud. 2) the play/pause button is a little too difficult to push. Almost hurts your ear when pushing the button. 3) my wife thinks they look very goofy on me, though she thinks most ear buds look goofy. You look at the pics and judge for yourself."
"December 14, 2020",Mike W,5.0,2,"I love my AirPods, but they aren't quite secure enough to stay in my ears while on my runs, requiring me to keep re-seating them back in my ears every 5 minutes or so.  So I was looking for a pair that would be more secure while working out, but not break the bank, and providing some of the conveniences of my AirPods.  These seem to be an excellent value and meet my needs.  The ear hooks keep them seated correctly while I run (6-8miles), the battery is perfect for my use, and I love the charging case has battery and charging indicators.  Sound quality is good, not great, but given the cost, it should meet your expectations.  Very happy with these headphones!"
"January 2, 2021",Caitlin,5.0,,"Update- I accidentally put these through the washing machine twice. I washed my clothes and did not remove them from the wash. The next evening, they had a bit of a funky smell, so I put em through again. Well, the individual head phone (I only listen to one at a time) made it through two washes!! It still works!!! I love these things!! Previous review: I love these head phones. I hike or do some sort of PT everyday, and use these while I do so. They stay in my ear while I am running or taking a sweatshirt off- they stay in my ear, which is why got them. I can stand it when they fall out, or when I have to continually have to readjust them- I don’t have to do that with these. Additionally, they do not hurt my ear after wearing them for many hours. Oh, which reminds me- the battery life is great. I go out hiking for 4 maybe 4 1/2 hours. They always last the entire hike, just as long as I charge them after each use. I do have to recharge them every night, they do not hold a charge otherwise. All in all, these have been my favorite earbuds."
"February 26, 2021",Jacquie + Spencer,5.0,,"These wireless earbuds surpassed my expectations. Fantastic sound quality and the battery life is more than I’ll ever need for any runs or hikes. The reserve battery in the case is a great feature when you’re not able to recharge right away, giving even more playtime to the buds. I’ve always had problems with earbuds fitting in my ears, but these fit like a glove! It even comes with different heads in case your ears are bigger or smaller than the heads it comes with. The removable heads also make for easy cleaning. The arms are solid enough to provide support without being painful to wear for extended periods of time, and I’ve never had the buds fall out of my ears. Although they don’t provide a seal or active noise cancelling, when they’re in your ears and music is on, you won’t be able to hear anything going on around you. My only complaint would be that the buds and case appear to be a bit lightweight and don’t seem very heavy-duty, but as long as I don’t throw them around I have no concerns beyond that."
"June 21, 2021",Cravitz,4.0,One,I really wanted to love these because of the price and reviews and they sounded really good but they were just not comfortable for my ears. I do have smaller ears so even AirPods are not the most comfy but I tried all three ear bud cushions and after a few minutes my ears were just hurting and I tried for over an hour but I would just be having to take out after a couple minutes. The sound is really great so if you are willing to try the comfort of them on your ears I would say the price and quality is worth it if they are comfortable for you.
"July 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"OVERVIEW: This pair works well for times when I don't want to use my nicer earbuds. FIT: They stay well while running and working out, thanks to the over-ear hook. SOUND: The sound quality isn't anything remarkable, better than the $20 pair I got but more muted than my $60 pair of Taotronics. Unfortunately it does make a popping sound sometimes when I'm running, like there's a plastic diaphragm in the bud that has unbalanced pressure. There isn't any active noise cancelation, just the passive reduction from having the buds in your ears. CONNECTION: The Bluetooth connection isn't the best with distance or with sudden changes in direction, like when I turn my head too fast it will drop out momentarily. BATTERY: The one part that is pretty slick is that the case has a display that will give you the charge remaining in the case, as well as show you how it's charging each of the buds. The case can recharge the buds quite a few times before running out, tho it is a bit beefy. CONTOLS: For some reason the controls on the buds don't work with my Galaxy S8. Not sure what the issue is there, but it's mildly annoying."
"April 8, 2021",Ivan B.,4.0,One,"Headphones were given as gifts.  My boys like the sound and performance of the headphones.  The charging pod is very handy, when on the go.  One big issue.  The battery, in the charging pod, is soldered directly to the PC board of the charging circuit.  There is not much impact protection at all.  Both of them have dropped the charging pod.  In both cases, this has caused the batter tab to brake off.  There was no repairing this brake.  Already replaced the Li-Po battery in one of them.  Working on replacing the other.  Be very careful with the charging pods.  They will not withstand a decent drop.  The battery should have better impact protection, or a LiPo battery should be connected to the pc board with wires instead."
"January 22, 2021",Imluvinit,1.0,3,These are great for working out! *they were great until last week. Barely lasted 2 months before refusing to charge. Only 1 side charged after the first month but I only used them for walking around the neighborhood. (walking out) so I figured I could deal with just 1 ear. Then the second side of the case stopped charging not soon after.
"March 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,5,"Stay on and sound great. Awesome! They work great. All functions work and they are easy to use. Play, forwarding, reject/answering calls. Volume is very important and works like magic. Would highly recommend and got my girlfriend a pair. Battery life is very good. Great warranty and customer service. Would totally buy more. Hard to get any better than what they delivered on time and was very quickly. Charges very easily and quickly. Great hard case and comes with accessories and extra earbuds that work really well. Great purchase. Everyone should really try these out since it is such a good product. Waterproof and they stay on no matter what I am doing outside in the sunshine. My girlfriend was so very happy with the gift purchase and talks about them everyday specifically the warranty, the great accessories, the so very perfect functionalities. On off forwarding answering volume and etc. Please buy them and you will be sold and happier than you have ever been. They are so very awesome and successful. I would've bought more if I had more family members whom would sincerely appreciate them for a lot of very good reasons. The noise cancellation feature is number one compared two the five other pairs i have recently tried. Solid product for over one hundred reasons. I am so glad i purchased these fabulous headphones multiple times as they are the perfect pair of headphones bar none. Everyone should go online to Amazon and purchase these over the top bad boys. Great item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"May 24, 2021",Hopmeister,2.0,One,"Sound quality is decent.  Not great, but far from mediocre. Unfortunately, these are useless for ANDROID devices.  As others state, you lose volume control.  You can only adjust via the phone, and that makes these earbuds worthless.  The manufacturer's BS about the difficulty of making them work with both Android and iOS is hogwash.  All the other manufacturers have figured it out, why can't they? Because Android was an afterthought for these earbuds.  Dont waste your time and money on these if you own an Android."
"December 28, 2020",Katherine,3.0,,"Update: I've had these for a while now and I use them pretty much exclusively with my airpods being the backup pair. Still loving the sound quality and the fact that they are pretty secure during workouts... However, I'm dropping a star because the lid off the case broke and I suspect there pin snapped and got stuck inside the case and may be interfering sightly with the electronics because now it makes a soft but nonetheless high pitched squeal when it charges. Annoying but tolerable, and at least it isn't a persistent squeal. Original: I got these as a backup for when my airpods needed charging, but it turns out I prefer them. They stay in and they're better at noise cancelling. I like the fact that the charging pod tells you what percent battery it has. Sometimes there's a little connectivity issue, which is why I can't 5 star it, but I've had the same types of connectivity issues with the airpods, too, and these were much less expensive, so I can't complain too much about it."
"June 12, 2021",Sky,4.0,,"iPod style headsets do not fit me, ever. These are super lightweight and very secure with the adjustable ear wrap. I sometimes forget I’m wearing them. They’re easy to pair up with your device and once paired, will automatically pair with that device by default. Sound quality is excellent for phone calls. No extraneous static. Callers never know I’m on a headset. Music sounds very good. With a full charge, I can listen continuously 12-15 hours. A brief top off from the charging case and I can go round the clock.  Charging is fast and easy.  Controls are reliable and simple to memorize. You can pause, play, adjust volume, advance to next track or go back to the previous. The only thing you can’t do is fast forward or rewind within a track. For the price, these headsets rival much more expensive ones. An amazing value. Would definitely recommend."
"December 31, 2020",lcrugby12,2.0,2,First pair received did not work Second pair works fine but occasionally the left and right don't stay paired They will not last half the day even when only talking for a few hours. Lastly-5 star review required for a warranty. look at the 5 stars. less than a full concise sentence due to just a few character requirement for the review process. how does amazon not stop this garbage?
"December 6, 2020",Kindle Customer margold,3.0,3,"I returned the item as I could not get it to charge - I went on their web site and followed their instructions for a non charging device but to no avail. Looked like a nice set, but if I cant get it started now, not sure I want to try it again."
"February 16, 2021",JackKennan,5.0,,"First earbuds I've ever owned and I am very pleased with them.  Connected easily to Bluetooth on my Moto G5 Plus.  Easy to operate controls.  Good sound for listening to music from my cell phone app.  They fit comfortably and securely.  Received a phone call while listening to music.  Clicked the MFB once and had a very clear connection.  Asked caller how my voice was coming through and was told it was perfectly clear.  The max volume is loud and distortion free (had to test it, but not for long to avoid hearing damage).  Occiam also has a great Lifetime Warranty offer.  So far, so great! 5/27/21 Update: The USB port became misaligned and the charging cable would not stay securely inserted.  Notified Occiam of the problem and just wanted the charging case replaced.  They sent me a replacement with everything included.  Couldn't be a happier customer with this company and their prompt service."
"July 12, 2021",Chris,1.0,One,"For a near 40$ earbuds, the designs, boxing and engineering are all poor. 1) You can see in the pictures, that they have their orientations wrong with the right earbuds being place to the left, and vice-versa. 2) The box that it came in had TONS of spelling and grammatical errors. Definitely a foreshadow for how poorly they pay attention to details. 3) The earbuds are connected as two seperate bluetooth device but they often have syncing problems. One earbud would play a delayed audio while the other plays normally, causing you to hear two different things. 4) Theres no touch features for skipping or replaying a song like most earbuds have. 5) Sometimes the volume up/down button works, sometimes it doesn't. 6) After a month, the earbuds will randomly connect to your phone even in its charging case. 7) After two months, the charging case stop working and now the earbuds are out of battery and they stopped working."
"November 1, 2020",Conlee O. McClain,5.0,2,I have been buying alot of earbuds. I have a big family and every one wants something different.  But these do it all. Great sound and low price. Most of the buds I have bought have less then Great stable connection. Most the time they work well but drop out occasionally. These haven't dropped out once. Another thing is most are ok but when making a call they have issues. These seem great. I sound clear and can hear with no issues.  I even wear them while vacuuming and I still hear well. They stay on my ear even during walks. Oh and unlike most they have an up and down volume so no accidentally turning it up trying to turn down. All In all they are well rounded and don't seem to have downsides. I would recommend these to anyone needing ear buds. The only thing I would change is to have a bigger battery and port to use to charge my phone like some other brands but would get again either way.
"December 28, 2020",Danny Hill,5.0,One,"I have gone through  a good half dozen wireless earbuds. While the sound is off one will fall out of my ear and get lost. That will not be the case with these. The sound is crisp and clear with good base. Of course I have only had these for one day. I especially love the lighted number tell me how much charge in the box. and the lighted scale telling me how much charge is in the earbuds. The hooks for the ears will be a master stroke for very active people like me. This is an addendum 1 week later. These are so conformable I forgot to remove them when I went to bed. Woke the next morning and had a shower. Later found my earbud in the shower. Stayed in my ear all night and only fell out while I was taking a shower. After drying it off with a towel I set it aside, not in the charger for few hours and then charged it and it worked just fine. I am going to buy another set so when I finally find a way to break or lose these I will have a back up."
"July 11, 2021",Nikki Todorovich,5.0,,"These are exactly what I needed! They work amazingly well. Paired super easily. Wrap around my ear comfortably with the confidence of them staying put. I bought these for a few purposes. 1. I needed something to sleep with. I have a kitten. Who loves to attack and chew on wires of earbuds, including while I'm asleep or forget them in bed. Fast forward to giving these a shot. And they're amazing... Battery life is great. Sounds great. And noise cancelling. Meditation and sleeping with affirmations has never been so peaceful! 2. Working out. Gardening. Outdoor activities of all kinds. Works great! Don't worry much about knocking them off. 3. Putting them in simply to drown out noise when shopping or other loud locations where I don't have noise level control."
"June 15, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,"Great sound, charge lasts about a whole day if you use it a lot. Very convenient to be able to charge on the go. I like that they go over my ear so I don’t drops them when working out. They’re also water resistant, I used them in rain and at the gym. Lifetime guarantee, fantastic costumer service. I emailed them long after I ordered them when they suddenly stopped charging and Amazon return was way past the 30days. They responded very quickly and sent me a brand new set for free! Very impressed!"
"November 20, 2020",R. Byrd,5.0,2,"bought these to use with my metal detector. they link up quickly and easily. i have used them for hours and they barely use battery. they fit my ears comfortably and after of hours of use they remain so. i have the volume turned down very low as they will blow your head off at up around max i would imagine. the little charging case is great as well and if you dont put it in a pants pocket it should be sturdy enough to last a long time, just be aware of the case and be gently with it. it could stand to be sturdy enough to carry it in jeans etc, but alas it is not. that notwithstanding i would highly recommend this product to anyone needed such devices"
"June 16, 2021",Sasha,5.0,One,"What's not to like about these amazing headphones? When I purchased them, they were on sale for a steal - hopefully anyone reading this will be as lucky. As for the headphones themselves, they came in very minimal packaging (which I appreciated). Everything was packed away neatly in a small box - the headphones, rubber tips for size adjustment, charging case, USB charger cord, and easy-to-follow instructions. I read the instructions and took the advice to charge the earbuds / their case before the first use, but they were already charged! How convenient is that? The headphones fit comfortably around my ears and don't budge as I work out in various ways (stationary bike, calisthenics, something akin to dancing, bendy yoga poses, etc). Their sound is *amazing* I get great audio quality, volume, and bass in particular. Their battery life is great - I haven't had them die on me yet. Being consistent with keeping the charging case charged helps immensely with this. It isn't difficult to do and worth having fully charged headphones each time I go to use them. When I ran into a minor issue (regarding a surprise that came along with my order), customer service was efficient and receptive, working urgently to leave me very satisfied. All told, this is definitely a brand I trust and would love to order more electronics from in the future - get you a pair!"
"May 26, 2021",Damon B. Wyatt,1.0,One,"Unfortunately, even for the price, theses earbuds are not a “good” value as others have said.  A good value implies that the earbuds function as described.  There’s a barely legible section in the description that refers to “volume” issues but mainly focuses on Android.  Bottom line: the earbuds + and - buttons which are supposed to change the volume on your iPhone do not function.  I tested this extensively when I received my first set and the buttons didn’t function regardless of the platform (YouTube, Spotify, Music App, Podcasts, Netflix...etc.).  I tried restarting the phone and then unpairing and repairing the earbuds but the effort was futile.  The volume of source did change when I changed the volume on the iPhone itself but the buds would not impact volume.  Other functions did work on the buds themselves (on/off, Siri...etc.). I contacted support who responded in 24 hours and after a few questions quickly processed and sent me a replacement.  It took about 3-4 days.  I received the replacement today and believe it or not, the new set has the exact same problem.  I’m not sure if it’s and iPhone issue (I’m using an iPhone 12Pro) or the IOS (14.4.2) but either way, the product for my use is a failure without the ability to use the volume buttons on the buds themselves. Customer service should receive a high review for the quick response but if two of the exact product have the same functional issue, there is a hardware/software problem that TY needs to fix or inform users prior to purchase."
"June 19, 2021",Jeannie,5.0,,So far these headphones have been great. They fit the ear well and are very comfortable. I love the different sizes of ear pads so they can fit inside the ear more comfortably for the wearer. The charger and amount of time to charge is very reasonable. Most people have computers or a wall plug that has plugs for USB cables. Plus I like the display for just where you are on the charge. That way you don't get caught in the middle of listening and lose the sound because your earphones just died. lol! Being able to charge the case or put the headphones in the case to charge along with the case is handy too. Especially if your out and about and need a charge.  It's case it small and will fit in a pocket or a bag of some kind easily. You wouldn't really notice it was there really.
"January 28, 2021",Nat R.,1.0,15,"Sound quality ok. Volume is pretty good, loud enough for a shop environment, but begins to distort at the max volume. Power cuts off intermittently in right earbud - this might be a fluke issue which doesn't occur on EVERY set, but I'm probably not the only person this has happened to. If you leave earbuds in case, they continue to drain battery of case even after buds are at 100%. If you leave case plugged in to charger, it does NOT prevent overcharging and battery issues begin to show (shorter supply at 100%, etc)."
"April 25, 2021",Teresa M. Rodriguez,3.0,,"Revised....these have really great sound, are easy to pair, live the charging case.  The only thing is they disconnect a lot.  If I'm out running for an hour, they will lose connection at least 5 times.  1 of them even cut power completely but turned itself back on after about 5 minutes.  Do I still love them?  Not so much.  I wish they were more reliable. Original review....I'm one of the suckers who believe I have to have the more expensive earbuds for good quality.  My earbuds stopped working after a few years and I learned of these from the Women's Peloton NPR facebook group.  I figured since I can easily return them, why not just try them.  OMG...these are really good!  They feel light and comfortable, easily pair, and then sound is crazy clear!  Thank you Occiam!"
"January 4, 2021",Tristan,5.0,,"Update 7/11/2021: Just purchased my 2nd pair of these due to misplacing my first pair. My original review still stands and will add the life of these headphones is AMAZING! I only have to charge the base once a week. I wear the headphones all day as I link them to my work laptop for my phone. For work purposes, no feedback on video calls, still clean sound both ways. Then on the weekends I listen to music all day without a hitch! These are hands down the best ever! Love how the case displays both the charge left on the case and on each headphone. The sound is crisp, clear, and good base! They fit comfortably and very ease to pair with my devices. The noise cancellation is excellent even with the volume not turned up very loud. Excellent product, great quality, and one of the best bluetooth headphones I've had in a long time. Highly recommend. (I was not paid for this review.)"
"April 17, 2021",Dakota_Ice,5.0,,"This is my initial review of the “Wireless Earbuds Occiam Bluetooth Headphones 48H” which I have had for a week.  I will update this review after using the earbuds over time.  The Occiam earbuds came in a nice box without excess packaging. The charging case is well designed of high quality materials. The charging case and earbuds were nearly at a 100% charge and I plugged in the case to get both to a full charge.  The USB cable could be a little longer (it’s 12 inches) but worked fine. It was very easy to pair the earbuds with my iPhone and the sound quality is quite good for the price.  I didn’t notice much noise cancelling during my initial use. The product comes with 3 different sized tips.  I like the ear hooks, which are comfortable and provide additional protection against the earbuds falling out.  I have had issues with previous earbuds not fitting securely in my ear, that is why I like the hooks, which are not that noticeable. I am pleased with this purchase!"
"May 12, 2021",Christian Cornejo,5.0,,"These were surprisingly decent for the price. I got these as a replacement for a set I lost (JBL Endurance Peak) and figured at this point the technology is refined enough to warrant solid cheaper products and got a bit of an upgrade actually at a much lower price. The BT is pretty good, and doesn’t cut out like my JBLs did from a moderate distance through walls (leaving my phone on my desk to use the bathroom, etc.). The earbuds have independent functionality and the fit works for me personally. It has a fuller sound as well, and without being an audiophile about it (because consider the context) I can say it’s pretty good if you have standard expectations. I have some criticisms like needing to push the outer button into your ear to play/pause (not a fun experience and awkward while running – a button on the bottom would be more accessible), but my touch controls got annoying while wet on my former set so you win some, lose some. It also doesn’t automatically turn off when you take them off (no sensors for it) but my former set was annoying about turning off completely so it’s an adjustment. Overall, a good product for the very low price and I’m pretty happy with what it does as someone who wears it to do some work at my desk and also while running and working out. Fit was really the priority for me and it meets that criteria perfectly. I'm giving 5 stars because while it's not perfect, I think it's a good buy and there aren't that many options out there that have a secure fit for active use without compromising on battery, sound, etc."
"May 4, 2021",karlee harris,5.0,One,"I absolutely love these. They stay on well with the ear loop and the ear pieces are the most comfortably fitting I’ve ever had. The battery life of the charging case is OUTSTANDING! I listen to mine approx 8 hours straight and put back in case to charge overnight. I literally did not need to recharge the charging case for 3 weeks! Others I had to charge daily or every other day. Sound quality is excellent. I also love that when removing it from the case it automatically connects to bluetooth so I don’t have to go into settings every time I use them and love that I can use one at a time, even if one were to be lost or damaged, the other would still function. The size of the case is a bit larger because of the ear loop, but I actually prefer it over the tiny cases. I have nothing negative to say."
"April 19, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"Updated: You do get what you pay for. This is cheap. I can hear fine when it work but there's no bass. Like others that complained, the Bluetooth goes in and out a couple of times when I'm watching a movie. It made the movie unwatchable. Majority of the time the connection is fine. I later found out that I was getting a bunch of other notifications from email, SMS, and etc. that was tripping the sound. There is no noise cancellation at all. I could hear everything around me while using it but I could also hear what I'm listening to. It is like the sound was enhanced without raising the volume. I guess that's what passive noise cancellation means. When on the phone call, I was told that my voice was extremely hard to hear and was recommended to return it. It enhanced the background noise versus reducing the background noise and enhancing my voice. The case is neat. The charge indicators for the case and for each ear piece is helpful to know when to charge the case and the ear pieces. It didn't bother me that it didn't support wireless charging. I have noticed that at times I have to wiggle the ear pieces to make sure that the connection touched to charge. The case is a bit thick which makes it hard for me keep in my jean pockets so I don't carry it everywhere. The placement of the ear piece is on the opposite side, meaning the left piece is on the right side and the right piece is on the left side. Not an issue but some getting use to. Lastly, at times, it was hard to tell which side the case opens."
"January 15, 2021",Just Me,5.0,One,"I have tried at least a dozen different types of wireless earbuds over the past few years in a desperate attempt to find some that don't hurt my ears after 30 minutes.  I can truly say that these are the first ones that don't bother me at all.  I put the smallest earbuds on them and because they go over my ear, the weight isn't constantly pressing on my inner ear. The sound is great - crisp and clear. They auto pair no problem (I've had other headphones that are a nightmare to pair, so this was very nice.) The battery life is amazing, and you can recharge them several times from the case.  Plus, there's a digital charge meter so you can see when you need to recharge the case. All in all, I am super happy with these earbuds, and would highly recommend them - especially considering how comfortable they are and the great price!"
"February 22, 2021",Just Another Customer,3.0,,"The LED display about battery life is in theory a great idea, but it's terribly inaccurate. For some reason the headphones sit in the case backwards - the right headphone is on the left, and the left headphone is on the right.  Inevitably, because the case is a flimsy piece of plastic, the headphones don't sit tight in the case and the charging contacts sometimes get knocked around. So you might wind up with one headphone fully charged and the other completely not charged if you accidentally move or touch the case (while closed) when it is trying to charge. Sound quality is tinny but pairing was at least relatively straightforward to my Amazon Fire Stick. I would have returned these headphones but forgot to do it within the Amazon return window."
"June 28, 2021",Katie,3.0,,"I wanted to like these ear buds so much. I like how they fit on my ear, you get three sizes for the rubber ear thingies for them and I used the smallest one provided. They were easy and comfortable to wear. Charging case is awesome. The only problem is, I'm a sweater when I work out. Because of this, the charging metals on the right ear bud RUSTED from my salty sweat and no longer charge in the charging case. That's right... I rusted the freaking earbud because I sweat too much when working out. The range it has for blue tooth capability isn't as good as Beats or Bose (but these are way cheaper, so expected). So if you sweat a lot from your head/face, I recommend investing in ear buds that are meant for that level."
"December 12, 2020",Heather,5.0,3,"I use these for work daily (10+ calls per day) and love them!  Easy to pair, battery life is decent, but between calls I will just pop them in the case since it charges the headphones several times on a single charge. I have used them on a couple runs and they were comfortable with great sound for music.  I didn't have to adjust them even with bouncing.  Highly recommended!"
"May 11, 2021",RJF in Illinois,5.0,,"I needed ear buds with the loops around my ears because I use them on my motorcycle and need to make sure they will not be blown out of my ears at speed.  These earbuds explain themselves right out of the box.  I  paired quickly them to my iTouch which I use for workouts (because I leave my phone in my locker to minimize distractions) and to my phone for non-workout uses and the music was very clear.  The bass isn't the greatest but, overall, the sound is very good, especially for the price.  It was a bit of a trial to change the ear tips but nothing that a little mechanical ingenuity couldn't resolve.  Overall, very happy and looking forward to megabuck Apple features and happy motoring at a much lower price."
"July 29, 2020",Tom,5.0,24,Excellent Bluetooth earbuds with microphone so you can talk on the phone while you’re driving or your kids can listen to their music while they’re in the car with you so you do not have to listen to their music very nice quality got nice bass and sound my kids absolutely love them highly recommended
"January 8, 2021",Marc,5.0,One,"Updated Review: These headphones have been great. I use them to work out and to watch videos on my phone and tablet. They are comfortable, stay in while working out and being active, and the sound is great. I typically only use them at about 1/3-1/2 volume, so they should be plenty loud for most people. The sound quality is sharp and crisp with good bass. Good battery life, I just put them in their case whenever I'm not using them and they're always good to go when I want them. I charge the case 1-2 times per week as needed. I had an issue when the case to my first pair stopped charging via the cable. I tried other cables and couldn't get the case to charge, so I ended up having to send them back. Amazon immediately replaced the headphones for me and the replacements have been working great. Things happen occasionally with any electronics. What matters is how the company responds. Not only did Amazon have my replacements delivered the next day, but the seller reached out to me to ensure that I had been taken care of and was satisfied. I would definitely recommend these headphones to any of my friends or family. Original Review: Stopped working after 2 months of light use. Never dropped, no water damage or anything like that. Just using them a couple of times per week while working out or to listen to music or videos on my phone. The case refuses to charge, have tried 4 different cables. Nothing. The headphones charge via the case, so the whole system is broken. Requested a replacement from Amazon as it was still within return period. We’ll see how those ones are."
"February 7, 2021",Dana Cottone,5.0,One,"Best $32 I've ever spent. For the money the sound is great! Are they bose earphones? No. But did I wear these comfortably in the airport, on the plane, in the car, around the house with great sound? Yes. The battery life is great too. And I don't know about other people's phones but on my Galaxy when I connect to the blurtooth it tells me how much battery life is left on them, which is nice. I also work out in these and have no issues. I originally bought another pair of OCC's thst you just put into your ear (no wrap around ear pieces) and I didn't like those. They felt like there were gonna fall out. But not these! Much better! Would 100% recommend and even give as a gift to someone!"
"January 10, 2021",Anna Marie,5.0,One,"I needed earbuds that would stay in my ears during fast spins and twizzles and also allow me to leave my phone at the wall of the rink. This set does that. I need to say that I am not able to tell you if the sound quality is that of a pair of Beats, per se, since I have no real experience here. But for my needs, the distance is about 185 feet from the wall to the end of the arena and the broadcast not only reaches, it never skips out if I face the other direction which happened with older Bluetooth hookups, so annoying. They are comfortable and the volume controls work well. The sound quality is great for my uses.  The battery life of the case is great and allows me to only need to recharge once a week. I'm happy I bought these, they are performing as I needed and hoped."
"February 9, 2021",Shay,5.0,,"This is it, guys!! It was a bit of a trial and error journey trying to find the right wireless Bluetooth earbuds. I had to return my previous Bluetooth wireless earbuds before finally landing on these. First, the Boltune Bluetooth V5.2, because they were too big of a fit for my small ears. And secondly, I returned the HolyHigh Pro Bluetooth 5.0. Although the quality was decent and they were comfortable to wear, they wouldn't charge properly AT ALL, which unfortunately defeated the whole purpose and experience. THEN it came down to this, the Occiam Bluetooth - very reliable for the past several weeks! Haven't had a single problem with charging it, and it charges fast! The sound quality is OK. Wasn't expecting it to be beyond just OK - just needed it to sound decent enough when listening to YouTube/music when walking outside. Also, love the easy-to-read digital number screen that tells you the battery life - takes the guesswork out for sure. Highly recommended!"
"June 1, 2021",Sam,2.0,,"So yet another poor quality Chinese product being sold on Amazon. How original. Don't let the positive reviews fool you. It's another company that will give you either a lifetime warranty or a second set of earbuds for free if you review their product. And no doubt they will e-mail you if you leave a negative review saying, ""give us another chance."" The earbuds don't pair left-to-right automatically. You have to turn on each ear. On top of that, you have to turn each one off manually. Lastly, the buttons are way too hard to press (especially on your ear) to change the track on your phone. I'm just tired of garbage products on Amazon being given ""5 stars."""
"May 8, 2021",Dana Svarczkopf,5.0,One,"Wanted a set of earbuds that had decent quality to use when cycling, but they needed to be a good value in case they fell out and got lost on the trail.  Willing to sacrifice a bit of quality to meet those needs.  These earbuds were just what I needed and more.  The around the ear design makes them virtually impossible to lose.  The sound quality and volume is great when using both buds together.  When on a road as opposed to a trail, I only use one so that I can hear vehicles with my other ear.  You do lose quite a bit of both quality and  volume when using only one, but I would think this is to be expected.  The nice thing is that they operate alone seamlessly.  And having all controls on both earbuds is a great feature.  The digital charge display on the case is a really nice feature that eliminates the guesswork of when to charge them for my next ride(s).  Battery life seems excellent.  Single ear bud only lost 10% for just under an hour of use.  On top of all of that, they warranty them for LIFE!  Even if you lose them!!!  Who does that?  Occiam now has a lifetime warranty on me as a customer!  I will look for their products first before considering any others."
"February 23, 2021",Konrad Buck,2.0,One,"BT connection is awesome, take out of case and they connect before I can get them on. Decent sound quality with better (not great) but better bass than last ones I purchased. The only con is a big one. I had read reviews indicating trouble with earbuds turning off sporadically.  Not true under normal circumstances. However, once I started sweating during a workout, nearly everytime I wipe my forehead with a rag just getting close to the earbud causes it to cut off. Then a few seconds later it turns itself back on. My wife borrowed them a couple times for the gym and she had same complaint. Kind of a big deal to me and obviously not an isolated issue. Very annoying. I submitted a quick and favorable review just after receiving earbuds. This is an updated review. Would not recommend."
"September 16, 2020",Cattyjackie,5.0,3,"I pick berries in the summer and like to listen to music when I'm in the woods.  The wires on wired ear buds kept catching on things and wireless ear buds that just stick in your ears kept falling out.  I've now used these twice and both times they stayed on perfectly, the sound is great and are very comfortable.  Only down to 85% on the batteries after using them for over 4 hours."
"June 28, 2021",Dylan,4.0,,"All around these are some seriously excellent headphones for the price. The charging case is lovely, it's all a fairly small package, everything fits nicely together, and the displays are clear and easy to read. The earbuds themselves are nice, fitting snugly in place without feeling tight or in the way. The sound quality is great, as good as any headphones I've personally tried, and the controls directly on them are pretty solid too. The battery life seems good, so far I've only worn them for a few hours at a time, about five at the most, and have not run into any issues there. Between the headphone battery and the case they definitely live up to the claim of a long battery life, and even with using them every day since they arrived, about four days overall, the case batter never went south of sixty percent, so for your casual every day use I'd say these are a great pick up, well worth the money. Easy to use, easy to set up, and functional all around, I definitely recommend."
"January 20, 2021",I love Amazon,4.0,One,"As you can see the part that goes around your ear has broken.  It just snapped in two Also the noise canceling is non-existent. Everyone complains about the background noise  You can't walk outside, drive, wash dishes or anything else. Battery life of the headphones is good. The charging case works well and it holds a charge for a long time. ***UPDATE*** The top has broken away from the case. The pin came out. Now to see about replacing since they broke."
"November 18, 2020",mtp133,5.0,3,"These work great.  They are very comfortable, the sound quality is good, and the charging case is nice.  I have many other BT headphones but they are attached by a wire to each other.  These are great without that wire especially when working out - gives you complete freedom and no more wire sticking to your neck.  I would highly recommend buying these."
"April 15, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"Downgrading my review to 1 star since one of them already stopped working. All of the sudden the right one sounds started cutting in and out or not working at all  sometimes wiggling makes it work for a few minutes. It's not a charging issue. I mainly use these for listening to audio books and occasionally while watching video content. The sound quality is fine for this purpose and the ear buds stay in place even when doing yard work/weeding, exercising etc. They are pretty comfortable. I usually use only one at a time so I can be listening to what's going on around me as needed and switch from one ear to the other every couple hours. Battery life seems good and the charging case works well. I would buy them again."
"January 21, 2021",Timothy Carpenter,2.0,,"These Bluetooth headphones are exactly what I have been looking for.  They are lightweight, great sound quality and very comfortable.  After putting them in, I literally forgot they were there.  Even with phone calls, it feels like I have all the privacy i need because of the noise canceling feature.  I get about 20ft distance from my phone to the headphones.  For the price these are awesome! Updated Review:  So Ive had these headphones for 3 months now, and from the beginning, I noticed that it would continue to charge non-stop and drain the charger unless I kept the right earbud out of the case.  It would charge the left earbud to full capacity, then turn it off, but soon as I put the right one in, it would charge and leave it on, so the right would continue attempting to connect to my phone, draining itself, causing it to charge from the case until the case ran out of stored charge.  Now, today, all of a sudden, the right earbud started loosing sound, fading in and out and finally just would not play any sound.  I turned it off, charged it and attempted to have it connect again, and same thing, faded out immediately and no sound.  Not too happy with it right now."
"July 13, 2021",Stephen T. Cooksey,5.0,,"Not sure what the poor reviews are all about but I have had ZERO problems in the almost year I've had mine. Sound quality is about an 8.5 ( they compare to my Beats 4s) but connectivity and battery life has been an A++. They claim 48 hours of playback I've been getting 100 hours battery life on the recharging case and never fail to connect to my Note 10+ immediately. They are certainly more comfortable than my Beats, connect quicker and more reliably. All in all they are my daily drivers. For the money you just can't beat them. One thing however is the lid to the case wants to fall off. But thats the only negative I've got."
"January 24, 2021",Katarax,5.0,One,"These arrived very nicely packed with clear instructions, a USB-C charging cable, and extra-sized buds.  The pairing was super simple, just charge them up to 100% and remove either the left or right earpiece and it automatically begins pairing. I like to lay in bed watching videos and in an effort not to disturb those around me, I wear these in bed.  The sound is crystal clear.  No muffling of noises, no static, crystal clear, and oh my goodness, the bass is punchy and powerful.  I am loving the battery case and the only thing I wished was that the charging was wireless but it's no biggie. I couldn't be happier.. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to leave me a message."
"February 18, 2021",Marie Guerierri,5.0,,"This is my fourth attempt at bluetooth earpieces that I can connect to my phone, use during phone calls and wear on walks without them falling out of my ears.  These were heaven!!!!  The ear band is very soft and flexible, not hard rubber/plastic like the others, so you hardly know that they are on your ears.  They fit very well the first time.  My friends tell me that the sound quality during phone calls is very good - they cannot tell that i am on a bluetooth connection. My only qualm is that they do go into standby mode and you have to wake each side up.  I haven't fully tested the battery power, but love the case that displays the remaining battery charge."
"April 7, 2021",Margarita Bustamante,1.0,,"The earbuds are very well made, it charges super quick and don't fall off of my ear like other similar earbuds. Revised: Product arrived with broken lid as you can see the first picture. I reported to Amazon and got a replacement, as I waited for replacement i tested the earphones which is why I had said above review. The second one arrived and it does not have the little metal rod that keeps the lid attached. They keep sending me broken product and replacements and just wasting my time. I'm returning both and will try to get full refund because I'm sure case is gonna be damaged and not charge properly if it can't close properly. Not sure if that's true but I don't Wana take any chances. Did not have a good experience with the product."
"December 1, 2020",Catheryne,5.0,2,"For the price, these headphones are really quite good. I really appreciate that each one has a different volume control, and they can be worn together or solo. I purchased these headphones to wear listening to music and podcasts while doing chores or working out. The charging case is a good size - not so small you'll lose it but still fits in a pocket. I did have one little flub where it almost seemed like they were cutting out from each other while I was wearing them. I charged them, and it solved the issue, so who knows? They're fine now. The battery life seems a little shorter than expected, but they still last a long time. I do love that you can charge the case! They are also very comfortable, and I don't feel like they're going to fall out of my ears even when running. All in all, they're worth every cent, and I'm very pleased!"
"January 12, 2021",MyRandaPanda,5.0,2,"These headphones sit very well in my ears without being too tight. The sound quality is amazing, and I can listen to my podcasts without having the volume on my phone all the way up. The mic works really well too. All my phone calls are crystal clear and I can answer and hang up with the press of a button. It works so much better than other earbuds I've tried that have you tap it like a fish in an aquarium. I really recommend these headphones, especially when wearing a mask can have other earbuds fall out."
"April 13, 2021",AXHEJAZ,2.0,One,"I do intense workout and the headphones would keep falling out. I used all of the earpieces and none of them worked it would still fall out it was very frustrating especially during cardio. I ended up paying the big bucks for a Beats version by Apple, and all I got to say is, ""you get what you pay for"". I haven't had one issue with the Pro Beats and yes it stays in your ear the whole entire time during intense exercising."
"December 29, 2020",leedar62,5.0,One,"I have tried numerous other  kind/types of ear buds and had returned all of them because of the way they fit/sound/or other negative issues. Yours is the only one I would rate at delivering what you suggested on the Amazon description and more. What I mean is no other ones give me the length of play back time yours does the volume control, sound, fit, especially when you are active. Neat display of battery levels. Ease of connecting to recharge by type ""C"" USB. And most important at a affordable price. My opinion those high level earbuds that cost 5 times(like Apple) more than  yours. Don't even come close to what your OCCIAM offers. As you can tell I am very unpaid happy/satisfied customer."
"March 30, 2021",T. Burgess,2.0,One,"Bad quality of life features. They don't turn off automatically when you put them in a case, so you can end up accidentally draining the headphones and the case if you forget to manually turn each one off. The connection is spotty, and the sound will randomly cut out on one side or the other. This makes using one earpiece for cycling or phone calls basically worthless. The true indication of the quality of this headphone is that I was relieved when they died after 5 months so I could justify replacing them with something better."
"April 15, 2021",Kat,2.0,One,"I was so excited to get these. They fit snug on the ears and don’t budge at all while I’m running. The charge is excellent and the charging case holds a charge for a long amount of time, but I am not happy with them. Sound cuts out on these constantly, which defeats the whole purpose of having headphones. Even on a full charge the sound starts to cut out and sounds like bad reception and one of the headphones just turn off while using it and I have to push the button on the side to turn it back on. I’ve used it with a new iPhone and the new Apple Watch 6 series. I don’t have this issue with other Bluetooth headphones and those devices. The sound quality is decent when they work, but it’s a bummer to be running and just lose sound."
"February 15, 2021",xBryMilx,5.0,One,"I have had these earbuds for about three weeks and so far they are great.  I use them several times per week and have yet to have to re-charge them.  The sound quality is good and I have not had any complaints from others while I have used them to make phone calls.  My favorite feature, which is becoming harder to find with earbuds, is physical buttons.  Many earbuds are touch sensitive and I have had poor experiences with those types of earbuds.  Even if you touch them just to make an adjustment, you risk disconnecting a call, changing a song track, etc.  With the physical buttons on these earbuds I do not have to worry about that.  They are also very light-weight and comfortable."
"April 28, 2021",NS,1.0,2,"They were great while they lasted, but that was only 4 months and one died.  I tried every reset procedure in the book, but it's gone.  Gone, I say.  May it rest in peace.  But you, o wise consumer, should heed my advice and not purchase or develop an emotion attachment to such a defective product. Update...contacted the seller who was kind enough to send me an identical replacement pair. And I mean identical. Even down to the left ear bud dying after only a few months in use. We buried it next to it's cousin. Again, I warn you, steer clear of these earbuds!"
"February 26, 2021",De W,2.0,,"At first great, but now each one seems to charge at a diff speed or hold a diff amount of charge. They last about 3hrs continually. But one dies faster that the other even though they're both at 100%. As a sound engineer it could be that one channel received more audio output, but I don't think that's the case. They're stereo headphones. They also seem not to stay in my ears while moving around which is frustrating, but I have small ear canals and am using the smallest fittings...I just don't know if I can recommend these to anyone. Idk how you can tell what percentage each headset is holding, but the case charge had a digital readout for the case itself only."
"June 11, 2021",Ashley Cummings,4.0,,"The sound has been great on the listening end! I have worn them outside in our awful wind and the only time I have complaints from someone I am talking to is when the wind truly is awful (for example sustaining winds of 20+ mph and also gusts...not uncommon for us to get 50+ mph gusts here and we have nothing around to block the wind either). I recently used these while operating my milking machine (rated at 91 dbs) inside our cleary built garage and I could be heard pretty easily over the machine still! Initially you get a pretty great charge out of the earbuds and the case but after probably a week or so of steady use the charge is not near as great but still does the job! The fit is pretty good but ocassionally they want to fall off (could be because of my hair or glasses or cap I suppose??). Ocassionally when listening to YouTube I have to ""close"" the app and open in back up because the buttons for some reason don't want to function properly but then they work fine after that. Overall I would recommend these!"
"April 27, 2021",Runner,1.0,One,"I bought these earbuds to wear on my runs.  Those expensive, hard , white earbuds are uncomfortable, and they want to fall out during my runs.  I bought the Occiam Bluetooth earphones back in February.  I was thrilled by the sound and comfort of them.  They come in a charging case.  Fast forward 2 months, and they will no longer charge. I have done a factory reset, cleaned the earphones to no avail.  My advice, they have good sound, comfort and not expensive, but don’t take the risk.  Look elsewhere."
"June 28, 2021",don s,3.0,,"I have had trouble with other ear buds staying in my ears.  I needed bluetooth earbuds for my computer, not necessarily for big sound for music. So I thought ear buds with ear hooks were a good idea.  Unfortunately the ear hooks prevent the ""speaker"" portion from seating deep into the ear canal.  As a result much of the volume and the sound quality is lost.  Although they are light and comfortable, the sound quality resulting from the poor fit is sub-par. The ear hooks make the fit very secure, however.  The pairing was very easy and the engineering seems excellent.  Will look for ear buds with better fit."
"December 10, 2020",R. B.,3.0,2,Sound quality is just OK. Left earpiece doesn’t stay in place for me when jogging and it also powers off and on frequently  after jogging for a while. Not sure if it’s from sweat/moisture touching the charging contacts but it’s extremely annoying. For the price they’re ok overall but they don’t work well for me so I’m returning them. I think a lot of the 5 star reviews on here are because the company promises a free gift if you write one.
"October 28, 2020",Raptor,5.0,3,"These wireless headphones stay in great with their soft ear hooks and have an impressive sound quality/volume for the cost.  The battery indicator in the case goes the extra mile by giving you a reading on the case itself and each individual ear piece.  The package came with a little scratch card, and I won a second pair!"
"February 28, 2021",Kevin Meadows,5.0,,"With the market being hot for wireless headphones and being a bit of a sound quality  freak, I didn't quite expect much from these because of their price, being you get what you pay for with most wireless headphones. I was blown away with these. I've had them.for over a month now and still have no zero faults. They sound amazing, and have amazing battery life. Yes, both earbuds and case have crazy long battery life, either bud can be used as mono mode, (some top brands can't), and they have a fast charge. I seriously reccomend these because they're comfortable, sound great, and the battery life is awesome. They're extremely simple to pair, all you gotta do is take the earbuds out of the case and they auto power on and go into pairing mode, and once they're paired, all you gotta do is take them out if the case and go. Extremely simple. These are a HUGE bang for you buck. I highley reccomend."
"June 29, 2021",S. Katz,5.0,,"The only complaint I have is that cordless earbuds don't hang around my neck when not in use.  With that fake complaint said, these buds are outstanding in many ways.  The bud batteries last a long time.  So long that I don't yet know how long.  Recharging in the case is very convenient.  Wearing one or two buds is  useful.  Controls are far better than my prior buds.  There is no ""redial"" option, which I love having made many middle of the night ""butt dials"" with old buds.  I like charge level displays for both buds and case.  Sound quality is good. Well done for an inexpensive ear bud."
"February 8, 2021",Mark C,5.0,One,"I went crazy trying to find the right bluetooth earclips for the gym. I bought the Beats Pro (+$200) and they were skipping on the bluetooth connection with so many in the gym on bluetooth. I tried these and same location same music device, :no skipping or pairing issues. Sound is to me within 80% of the Beats Pro. Additionally, i wear a sweatband for my cardio and with the Beats ,,,,as the sweatband gathered sweat and became heavier, it put enough pressure on the Beats earbud controls to trigger the pause function on the headphone itself. With these, the functions on the earbud itself require a dedicated ""push"" and also you have to hold down to activate a function. So no accidentally brushing the headphones and causing an unwanted mode change. I am very happy with this purchase.  The bass is good and also the volume can go loud against background noise in the gym. Make sure you try the various size buds included to get the best snug fit for the most bass experience. If you are looking for ear clip headphones that won't fall off, save yourself time and hassle. These are great. And I am a VERY picky guy and not shy about going through the hassle of a return. but i am KEEPING these."
"May 27, 2021",Antonio Lo Bello,4.0,One,"These are good, but they sure don't last. My right one won't charge, and when I sit there and hold it in place for it to charge it says it's fully charged but it dies in 10 minutes.  and they disconnect randomly or shut off. For the price I guess this is to be expected? I mean, a few months worth of playtime? Even for cheap Chinese products I expected to get a year out of it."
"February 19, 2021",Patricia,1.0,2,Haven't even had these for 6 months and the left one broke. There is absolutely no noise canceling on these. The battery charge doesn't even last a full day. They will turn on sitting in the case and connect to the phone when I dont want it to
"February 10, 2021",Gearchick,5.0,One,"I am leary of pay for reviews stores so I will not leave a good review that isnt warranted. This time im happy to say it is. I have a hard time finding earbuds that work for me. for some reason most hurt my ears bad enough that I cant wear them, or the sound quality isn't there. These do both! I am on the phone all day with insurance carriers, I hear them fine and they don't ask me to repeat myself or complain of the call quality or of not being able to hear me. Battery's last at least all day (12-14 hours) maybe more but I havent gone past that. I am extremely happy with this purchase and I will be ordering a second pair for backup!!! get these, you won't regret it!"
"December 23, 2020",Big Z.,1.0,3,I can't believe all these 5 star reviews. This product didn't work for me out of the box. The volume up and down don't work properly. The sound quality is poor. I've had less expensive ear buds that had much better sound.  They feel cheaply made.
"May 31, 2021",Richard Cassiani,1.0,,Do yourself a favor and bypass this worthless piece of junk.  The unit came fully charged but after the battery got low the buds would not charge in the charging case. I called Amazon Support and we tried a few things to get the ear buds charged but nothing worked.  It appears that the charging case was defective. Amazon offered me the options to take the refund or get a replacement item and I opted to take the refund. I read all the one star reviews And it appears that  I am not the only one who experienced charging difficulties. So unless you enjoy headaches I would avoid this product. And by the way the volume was not great. I can set the volume to half of what I had it for these  Buds  with other earbuds are you home and have a better listening experience. Let the buyer beware
"July 6, 2021",Josh Williamson,1.0,One,I loved these earbuds..... While they worked. They are a good fit and volume is pretty decent. They worked great for almost a month. Now they disconnect intermittently. If it follows the other reviews then they will stop charging completely in a few days. I have been reseting and trying to fix for a few days but I found out today that my return window was 1 month which was 5 days ago. Earbuds that only last a month are a waste of money. I disregarded the negative reviews when I purchased these cause every electronic company will have some issues. Now I believe they have a quality control issue. 1-2 failing in a month is 1 thing but now reading they are tons of these failing in the first month. Save your money and buy a better brand with a actual warranty.
"May 3, 2021",Joe Broderick,5.0,11,"Great earphones! They are five star, top notch, top shelf, top of the line, luxurious, superb, superior, A++, highest quality, supreme value, 100% splendid, perfect tens across the board, flawlessly performing, copper bottomed, brass tacks, silver plated, golden gilded, worth twice as much as the price, royal flush, sleek design, stylish form factor, second to none second quality, smooth hand-offs, intelligent Bluetooth handling, commendable range; the best of all earphones I have bought; the only thing missing is a tag in the earphones to keep track of them for ADD people like me! @omnicadabra"
"December 1, 2020","Bishop J.L. Spann,Jr",5.0,2,"This is my first pair of having earbuds.  I've always be skeptical about earbuds because it doesn't appear that they'll stay in your ear so, the wrap around ear piece is a plus for me.  Also, I love the fact that these earbuds can be used either together or independent of each other.  Very easy to sync to my phone and the quality of sound is not bad.  The charger case gives you the exact battery strength as well.  I'm totally satisfied at this point!"
"February 3, 2021",Classic Stu,2.0,,"Day 1 and great so far nice sound, good connection and stays in my ear Update: Day 4 and sound quality is as bad as the cheap ones I was replacing. They do fit nicely in my ears and music seems to do alright but I chose the wrong product for what I need. Just because they are capable of answering calls and talking to Google Assistant doesn't mean they are good at it. I love the buttons though; I would hang up on someone every time I adjusted my earbud with the touch controls. The left earbud stopped connecting  at all unless the right one was on. On paper these look awesome... to achieve those lofty goals either costs more money or development"
"November 7, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,2,"I was a little upset to see that they give you a card for amazon gift card only if you give a 5 star rating, so I decided to wait in order to leave an accurate review. My headset was working good but then after 3 uses they would start to cut out and have a static noise to them. The right one would cut out completely and then return. It’s annoying."
"June 4, 2021",Isaac Fernandez,1.0,,"These headphones are really bad. I was certain these headphones would be an upgrade to some old ones I’ve had a couple of years, new product I wanted to try and my goodness it’s not good. The sound quality is subpar, music isn’t clear it always sounds muddied and my old ones (which were cheaper mind you) sounded far better. Idk if my ear stopped working but I hadn’t thrown out my two year old headphones yet and they sound infinitely better. People sound muffled over the phone, just bad overall. When I’m on a phone call I’m at the beach, not because the quality is so great that I’m making trying to make this horrible comparison like it’s a good thing, it’s that it’s so bad I needed to make a bad comparison. I sound like I’m underwater when there’s silence, and can’t be heard at all if I’m outside and it’s windy. Hence, beach.... not in a good way. At least it’ll hold a charge for a long time! But what’s the point of a headphone that’ll last for hours if it sucks this bad?? The case doesn’t die for a long while, headphones last like a whole 7 hours of use. These would be fantastic, if they were so horrid. Wait wait wait, maybe you got a bad one! Maybe this is just a faulty set of headphones and a replacement will do me good! I THOUGHT SO TOO!! But guess what?? The replacement was just as bad as the first, needless to say I’m disappointed, next time I’ll be sure to not switch brands I guess."
"June 24, 2021",Mistercraig,1.0,,I ordered this item based on the high number of positive reviews.  I liked how light they were when delivered and seemed to feel comfortable when I tried them on.  The case was a little flimsy but didn't seem overly so.  The biggest problem is that the volume options do not work with my iPhone 12 at all.  The sound can be adjusted from the phone itself but if I try to adjust them from the headphones the volume slider would flash on the phone and then nothing would change.  I called in and troubleshot the first pair and agreed to an exchange as I wanted to use these for running.  The second pair arrived quickly but had exactly the same problem.  No choice but to return them.  They were unfortunately a total waste of time.
"April 8, 2021",Flynn,4.0,One,"I’ve owned 4 different pairs of wireless headphones now and all of them felt pretty much the same until these. Each headphone can operate on its own meaning you can listen to either one without needing the other out of the case and switching to both is as easy as taking the other out. The battery life is great, I’ve yet to have one die on me from a full day of listening to it, the power display doesn’t show a percentage for the headphones (just the case) but give bars in 25% increments. The only negative I have is the sound quality. Don’t get me wrong they sound good but for certain ear types you may experience the audio having a slight...muted sound to it. It’s an easy fix though if you mess around with your music players EQ Settings All around best bluetooth headphones I’ve used."
"January 5, 2021",Ryland,5.0,,"** Edit April 11, 2021 ** Customer support via email was amazing, but these earbuds just don't seem to want to work more than a few months. I ordered these for the first time back in 2020, and i loved them. Worked PERFECTLY. Easily gave a 5 star review, even won a free 2nd pair. Satisfied customer. Until the charging case stopped working. I contacted their support team via email and after sending a video as proof, they had no problem sending me a new pair, and assured me they were working on fixing the issue. They may still be working on it, but here we are a few months into my 2nd pair, and the charger box is broken, once again. No lights, no charging. I believe it happened after I tried charging the box itself. Bottom line is: These earbuds were amazing, especially for the price, And 5 stars for customer service. But until they figure out why the charging case randomly stops charging, these earbuds are just dead and useless clutter :( * Original Review in 2020, 5 stars * Amazing wireless earbuds!! Highest quality for the most affordable price out of all the others here on Amazon. The packaging was the same level of quality as my Samsung Galaxy Watch!! No regrets, hands down a great affordable set of earbuds."
"April 28, 2021",Blake j. Valentine,5.0,,"They fit nicely, cancel noise pretty well, have pretty good sound, calls are nice and clear, connect fast and last over 8 hrs plus the casing is fast charging and durable, neat how it tells the individual earpiece battery as well as the case battery. Does have some drawbacks as you would expect, it sometimes cuts off for a second varying amount of times(no more than 3 as of now) and not as much bass(for those who like at least a little more bass than usual with their music) and the main button is hard so pressing it shoves the earpiece in my ear(sucks and hurts as you'd imagine)"
"November 18, 2020",N.B.,3.0,One,"I thought the description claimed that these had a long battery life. Not so! If I charge the today and don't use them for a day with them fully charged, there's only half the battery life left when I am ready to use them. That's so disappointing. So, I only get half the battery life which is used up in one or two lengthy conversations. False advertising and unfortunate because otherwise they were exactly what I was looking for."
"February 1, 2021",Bay,2.0,,"For Christmas my mom wanted a set of wireless earbuds that she could use while working out. Normally she listens to music, or watches a show while on the treadmill. She didn't want super expensive ones, so I thought these would be perfect. She thought these would be exactly what she needed, and charged them right up. After just her first time using them they were not as expected. They barely had any sound, one of the sides kept saying ""power off"" and ""power on"" so she had to go with just one side. She didn't understand because she had connected them to her phone, and charged them up fully. She does not use them anymore, after she gave them multiple chances. Even if the one side wasn't acting up they would still not work well based on the sound quality and comfortability."
"February 24, 2021",AmazonThirdEye,4.0,,Didn’t much care for the foily coil sound that would be produced if I turned my head a certain way and I honestly didn’t think the sound quality was anything special as well as the bass. More often than not that foily coil in the earbuds wouldn’t set right and I’d have to adjust them to achieve the proper sound and I didn’t like that. There are other TWS earbuds out there that are better imho but these seem to be adequate for a large chunk of people given the reviews. I used these until the better TWS earbuds that I ordered came from Amazon. Just wanted to try these out given they’re highly rated
"February 13, 2021",E. Brown,5.0,One,"Great value and the LED status on the charging case is great. We live on a sailboat which is where I use these most of the time, so I needed a pair that stays in place when in use. If they fall out, chances are they’re going for a swim. With these I never have to worry about that, and they’re still extremely comfortable. Battery life is great, so no complaints at all. I would definitely buy them again."
"April 13, 2021",CAROLYN,5.0,,"These are excellent earbuds. First time connecting was fast and easy. The best part is that if you use them with a certain device most of the time, they automatically connect to the last device. I use them mainly at work connecting to my phone to play music. I like the loops over the ears because my other earbuds fell out easily when I got up to walk to the copier! The sound quality is good and easy to adjust. The battery life is awesome! You can use one or both, charge one and use one. There is a display in the case to show the battery level."
"February 1, 2021",Diana Hanshaw,5.0,14,"These earbuds were easy to pair, the sound quality is great and they are very comfortable. I've been using them since the end of Jan and I absolutely love these. The sound is great. I can turn up the sound on either one or both. I can answer my phone or hang up using the right earbud. They are comfortable and the battery lasts a good long while before I have to charge the case. I put the buds in the case when I'm not using them so they are charged and ready to go when needed. I'm not able to use the ones that just sit in the ear as my ears are small. These also have different size caps to fit in the ear."
"December 7, 2020",KarenatPace,2.0,,"Update: started using these earphones in Dec 2020 and they were great. They were so great that I mentioned it to my friends and co-workers. Now its April 2021 and the left earphone is not working.  There is NO sound coming from the left earphone.  I have un-paired it from my phone and paired it back, but only the right earphone works.  This really is ***quite disappointing*** as I used these earphones almost everyday one at a time so that they last longer. So I have changed my rating from ""5"" to ""2"" stars because I only used the earphones for 4 months and now it doesn't work.  I expected the get more use out of them than 4 months. My Dec review is below: Just got these earphones and so far they are working great. I use them with my phone. Pairing was easy, and the battery life so far is good. Will update this in a month or two if anything changes."
"May 28, 2021",Matt L,4.0,,"Sound 6/10 Treble 9/10 Bass 5/10 (They aren't expensive...so don't expect expensive sound, but not bad or fuzzy at all) Microphone 6/10 Range of Bluetooth - 9/10 Surprisingly long range Battery 6/10 - They last for awhile, and the case battery is now having trouble keeping up with charging properly Fitment 9/10 - for my average sized ears, fall asleep in them and wake up with them still on. Noise Cancellation is passive, if they have active it's a joke. Don't use them for gaming, there's a crazy delay."
"June 3, 2021",Sudan but not Egyptian,1.0,,"Poorly made product and design in comparison with other models on Amazon. Customer service was inconsequential. Although these were comfortable and had good sound, they would continually disconnect and power off. I tried everything from charging, to rebooting, to replacement. Nothing worked. I contacted Customer Support and was offered a  free replacement, to which I unfortunately agreed to. Same issues. The Occiam team offered to refund my money to “Remove The Negative Feedback From The Amazon Review Section” to which I agreed to. And the funds were never refunded to my account. So, I am rewriting the negative feedback to inform other consumers of the Occiam defects and poor customer service...I’ve ended up ordering another brand and have been very satisfied"
"December 29, 2020",John Powe,5.0,One,"The product was bought to replace another brand that was not very good at all.  This product worked exactly how the manufacture said it would.  The ear pieces paired together right out of the case immediately without a problem.  After the two ear pieces paired then they both paired with my computer without a problem.  It was simple easy and quick.  The product has held a charge over at least 6 hours of continued use, the case has held a 90%+ charge over the past 3 days, even after charging the ear pieces twice during that period.  So far I like these.  This review is after using them for 3 days."
"June 10, 2021",Elizabeth Bunker,3.0,One,"The audio is really good. Noise cancelation is possible, but I really have to wedge them in an uncomfortable way, or I have to deal with hearing Moana behind my music 🥴 The biggest issue is that the volume control buttons do not work at all, and its a 50/50 chance whether the pause buttons work or not. It might be worth mentioning that my charging case had obvious moisture that could be seen on the LED screen from the minute I opened the box. I don't think that would affect the buttons on the actual headphones from not functioning properly, although I guess its possible. Since my charging case seems to hold a charge just fine (so far), it's not worth a trip to Kohl's to make the return."
"June 22, 2021",Kindle Customer,1.0,,"I purchased these at the end of January and on June 19 the left side stopped working.  In addition whenever I take out the right earbud I hear ""power on"" instead of ""connected"" and evntually it too shuts off.  Amazon Customer Service was trying to put me in touch with the company but we were cut off. Before calling back I read the reviews and realized speaking with the company would be useless. The problem is universal. According to most of the negative reviews, after three to five months of use, the left side will stop working and you will have charging issues. Occiam management obviously has no shame since zero effort seems to have been made to correct the problem that everyone has. When these earbuds worked they were great for my needs but after less than five months they are junk taking up space."
"June 21, 2021",R. Rogers,2.0,,"I loved the earbuds while they lasted. I bought them Feb.8 and found they were comfortable and easy to use. Last week (June17) the charging case stopped taking a charge. Even after cleaning the connections as directed. Then yesterday as I unplugged the cord, the cord snapped off from the plug. No way to repair it, and since I was just unplugging in order to put the whole thing away indefinitely because it doesn't charge, it is a total loss. I will use the earbuds until they too lose power, then chalk it up as ""buyer beware."" I would recommend spending more and getting a better made product."
"May 30, 2021",Nisha,2.0,,"These headphones have held up well in the gym, but if you put your phone on DND like I do in the gym or during a meeting.  The headphones will still ring although it is on silent/DND which is very annoying.  The noise cancellation is very bad at filtering out high frequencies i.e. birds outside.  They also do not have a long range.  You can hear someone talking, but they can't hear you to well if you walk away.  Considering the price I am not sure if I should care, but considering these are WIRELESS lol .. I should be able to leave my phone a good distance.  This headset might go to 3ft max of uninterrupted space."
"January 31, 2021",Kelly P.,3.0,,"These would not stay charged and made noises as it was being charged. The case is supposed to charge the headphones, but it would not keep a charge. EDIT: The headphones were not working for my wife on her iPhone. I recently used them and the case does not stay charged longer than a day at most. I did not have issues actually using the headphones, but just know you cannot go more than a day without charging the case. I found the sound to be good and it was easy to use. Customer service contacted us about our concerns via email and did offer to return our money and said that they had reviewed our original concerns"
"February 13, 2021",Marni Sweetland,2.0,One,"UPDATE - Removing 2 starts. I Bought these specifically to use for phone calls and video calls based on reviews that people had a good experience. I am now getting feedback that people can not hear me on calls. They will be fine to wear for other activities but I will need to find something new for calls. (I tried Galaxy buds but they didn't fit my ears and then I lost one, so I'm going to research more.) --- These are very good for the price. Just was on the phone for 5 hours and the battery drained so I'd say they have 5 hours, not 8. They are mostly comfy but they do feel a little big where they insert into the ear. They came with 2 extra earbud covers but they all look the same size to me. I will have to search for other smaller earbuds (covers)t to see if they are more comfortable. The first call I made the other day the caller said the sound wasn't good. All other called said it is fine. I've had a little connection problem where they didn't show for my phone but it had since worked fine. I don't think the noise cancellation was good. A caller told me they thought the sounds on my end were too much when I had my window open even though I didn't think the sounds were very loud."
"July 2, 2021",Ray,4.0,One,bought these  6 months ago and think they are great except one thing that is really driving me nuts. I listen to audio books while walking or biking and no matter what my volume is set at when I get a call on phone it goes full blast it just blares INCOMING CALL and I can't turn it down once I answer  the volume is normal.
"June 24, 2021",Ken Tisdel,1.0,,"Positives: battery life was surprisingly good. Bluetooth connection was easy to set up and connected quickly during use. Charging was easy and quick. Negatives: sound quality isn't great. None of the three provided earbud tips fit well.  I was constantly adjusting the earbuds while in my ears to try to get a better fit and better sound. The case would only charge with the provided USB cable which was only 12 inches long, didn't work with my other USB cables. The earbuds frequently lost connection with my phone when the phone was in my pants pocket. The right earbud stopped producing sound after about 6 weeks of use, it turned on and off but didn't make any sounds. Overall the earbuds look good but don't perform well and don't hold up, stopped working after 6 weeks.  I won't be purchasing this product again."
"June 2, 2021",Suke,1.0,,The head phones are difficult to connect to different devices. It is not smart. I have bought much cheaper headphones that are able to switch from one device to another. This one u need to turn of the bluetooth from the device after u disconnect so that it can then connect to another. This is so frustrating compounded with the fact that when you scan for the headphones it takes a number of tries to appear. For the monies ($33) i paid for those headphones. I am very unhappy with it. The design also is uncomfortable.
"February 16, 2021",Renita Knight,5.0,,"I have had these ear pieces for about 3 weeks and I have not found anything I dislike about them.  Even the way they charge is great.  I place them back in their case and plug the charger into the case.  The case has an indicator that tells you when the charge is complete or notes the percentage of the charge.  They are not earbuds that fall out when they get wet or from a strong twist of your head.  I can walk, run, jog comfortably in them.  The sound is good and  if you only want to use one of the ear pieces, you can.  Each side works by itself which is great when I am driving because I need to hear the traffic around me."
"April 29, 2021",Nati Time,5.0,,Easy to set up and quickly pair. I read reviews that had trouble with charging about 75% but that's what the station battery level is. You need to charge the charging station first. The earbuds charged quickly and I like that they hook around my ear and won't fall off when mowing the lawn. I've only had them for a day and they've worked for Zoom meetings so I'm not wires to my laptop. It is a little strange that the left ear is on the right and the right ear is on the left in the charging station... but not end of world or anything.
"December 28, 2020",T. loves cats,5.0,One,"Pairing took about 2 minutes to complete, and then I got to listen to the sound. For the price, you just can't beat these headphones! I was really impressed. I made a couple calls to friends and call quality was good on both ends as well. The case could use a little work; it's not very user friendly for arthritic hands. I haven't had them llong enough to run down the battery yet, so that's a good thing - seems like battery life is pretty darn good because I've been using them a lot during workouts and around the house cleaning. I may even order a second pair to use just for my tablet while watching movies in bed at night so I won't be a disturbance! Love them!!"
"June 24, 2021",Joseph W. Carney,5.0,,"This is not a full review, that will come later. The product arrived on time and was as described. Everything is in working order and I'm able to connect to my iPhone and use them while working out The controls (audio level and connect/disconnect) work, They are comfortable with the over-the-ear hook nonintrusive. I like that they don't come out while I'm walking.  The sound is OK for what I purchased them for. I'll post another review in a month or so. So far have used them for up to 2.5 hours and still had battery life in them."
"January 31, 2021",anna_mcg,5.0,,"The upside: these pair instantly, are easy to charge, the case makes them convenient to transport. The sound quality is fine for cheap earbuds. The downside: The case is extremely flimsy--any time it falls, it breaks in half. Additionally, the earbuds are uncomfortable if you have small ears. They did not come with varying sizes of tips like earbuds normally do--the basic ones are too big for me. I got smaller tips separately, but these are still not comfortable for extended periods of time. Finally, it's quite strange that the left piece goes on the right side of the case, and the right piece goes on the left. Are these a decent alternative to airpods? Sure. But if something happened to these, I would look elsewhere for a replacement."
"February 3, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"Firstly, the sound is awesome. I've struggled to find a good headphone when it comes to call volume and these are wonderful in that respect, loud enough, rich enough and the person on the other end never notices I am on headphones. My issue is with charging.  I love that the case readout that indicates charging and battery life.  The case must be charged to full each day, sometimes twice.  The headphones also dont remain ""off"" all the time when you turn them off and put them in the case, so they will drain it pretty fast, and then run out themselves.  If I am going to be using them a lot during a given day, making sure they are charged is a hassle- the case only seems to charge off of USB C cords plugged directly into a surge protector, if there is an adapter at all they dont charge. Sound is great, very comfortable, charging is pain."
"April 2, 2021",Victoria G,5.0,,I love these earbuds! The ear hooks fit very comfortable over my ears which helps me control how much of the bud is inserted in my ear without  worry that they will fall out. I mainly use them for listening to music/audiobooks and phone calls and I am very satisfied with the sound quality. I rarely use both L and R at the same time so I save a lot of battery life alternating them. It’s also really helpful that the case shows how charged each bud is as well as how charged the case is. As for fit these are the first ones I would actually recommend to a friend.
"May 14, 2021",Paul,3.0,,"These are okay, just okay though. As far as for sports or even going for a run, absolutely do not purchase. I find myself having to push these back into my ears constamtly on a moderately brisk walk; I couldn't imagine running with these on. The wrap around ear piece doesn't mold to your ear or anything. Just a flap of rubber that for some reason clears the top of my ear by about 1.5 cm, I assure my ears are not small. If the rubber piece that wraps behind the ear had a wire in it to hold the ear buds to your ear it would make a huge improvement. And perhaps do something about that big gap at the top of the ears. The ear wrap should rest on top of the ears. These are solely supported by the ear buds themselves until they slide out at which point the sound quality becomes greatly compromised as the ear buds are no longer in your ears but resting just on the cusp. The angle of the ear buds in relation to the rest of the device is a tad awkward as well. Was really expecting to get more for the price I paid. These are at best okay for going for a walk on a light breezy evening. When sitting completely still and the ear buds actually stay in place inside my ears the sound quality is wonderful. Trust me though; you do NOT want these for running or sports."
"February 20, 2021",Dom,2.0,,"For the money and description, I expected better.  When I went running with them the first day.  After about 25 mins they started to disconnect then connect.  They were fully charged so I know battery was not the issue.  The only thing I could check, are they sweat proof.  The set I have seems to not be very sweat resistant, I was able to make them shut off with just a little sweat on the connectors. Update: right ear no longer charges. I checked to see if the terminals were clean but the right side will not charge."
"March 31, 2021",Ken S,2.0,One,"Although there are many nice features in these ear buds, for some reason they would disconnect and reconnect repeatedly during use. I have other Bluetooth earbuds and do not have this problem. I have also been told that the sound quality is poor for people on the other end of a phone call.  Unfortunately if call sound quality is low and it cannot connect and remain connected, all of the other features are meaningless."
"January 3, 2021",CoinCorraller41,5.0,One,"Excellent. Lightweight and comfortable on the ears. The hook is flexible and soft which makes it a plus. I am able to literally shake my head and the earbud stays in and on my ears.  The sound is good and you don't have to turn it up very high to hear it. The display is bright and easy to read, really helpful for someone like me that uses corrective lenses. The price is great too, I paid double what this cost for another brand earbud that had the same quality.  Would DEFINATELY buy again....because I bought for husband and I can't keep them.  :-)"
"July 4, 2021",Daniel,1.0,,"Battery last a long time but that is pretty much the only upside to these. The volume control on the headsets do not work, I thought it was only on my phone because I have a Razer Phone 2 so I thought maybe it was that buy my wife has a Samsung and it does not work on that either. Also each time you put them back into the charger it takes about 25 percent of the battery so a fully charged case you should probably get 4 charges off of it making them last for 32 hours or so total."
"February 16, 2021",Malcolm T.,2.0,,"I hate to write a bad review of the product. This requires that I have to relive the disappointment but I wish somebody would’ve told me before bought this product that the battery life sucks. They connect wonderfully. I love that either one can connect independently of the other. The sound quality is great. Maybe they are great for music but I don’t use them for that. I talk on the phone a lot and these are the worst Bluetooth earphones as far as battery life that I ever owned. Two hours of talk time then “battery low” warning comes on and maybe five more minutes then they die. I have to charge them 3 times a day. Maybe I got a bad batch as I did not see this issue in other reviews. Other than battery life they are fantastic. If you can’t enjoy them for very long then the whole experience suffers. FYI, I have owned these for about three weeks now."
"July 14, 2021",A. Singer,2.0,,"After testing on a brief video chat, I used these to deliver a training at work.  I noticed that trainees were dropping out mid-meeting and saw the chat messages that my audio was breaking up.  Terrible experience!  For this alone, I would have given 3 stars, but the fact that these can only be connected to one audio source at a time loses another star.  If using with my laptop for work and I receive a call, I would have to remove an earbud to take the call - just annoying."
"May 18, 2021",Mz.Consulting Developer,2.0,2,"FOR SOME REASON, THE DEVICE STOPPED WORKING. NOW AFTER HAVING IT A MONTH! NEOTHER ONE OF THEM WORK NOW. AND NOW I CAN'T RETURN IT. I'M NOT PURCHASING ANOTHER BLUETOOTH FROM HERE AGAIN!!!"
"December 8, 2020",Rebecca Riggs,5.0,One,"This is the third set of wireless headphones I have purchased.  The sound is good, noise cancellation is good, but not TOO good.  I like to be aware of my surroundings, so I usually wind up taking one out when walking alone. You can pause and restart, and answer the phone with a touch on the side. (  one brand I tried  were so sensitive that my hair brushing against them would turn them off. These are perfect.) I also have smaller ears and other brands don't fit right and pop out.  These are a better fit, but the over-ear part sold me for sure. Third time's a charm!"
"May 8, 2021",Kelly M,5.0,,"Fantastic price!! Great sound quality.  Case holds a charge for days at a time. I work overnight stocking, so I wear at least one earbud 5 nights a week, 8 hours a night.  I usually only have to charge these once a week, and even then it’s not usually fully empty of a charge. Comfortable to wear, and durable! They’ve fallen out and/or gotten caught and pulled off my ears and bounced off floors and counters, and have held up amazingly!! They fit well with mask straps also.  Not sure about eyeglasses, as I don’t wear them, but feels like they would be slim enough to work ok with glasses."
"February 17, 2021",Brett Coon,5.0,,"I usually don't write reviews about my products but in the past I've paid money into expensive products that weren't the best of the best. These are a great investment for my new Samsung S21 5G (regular series.) I just upgraded to this phone and was disappointed with the lack of headphone jack and chose these headphones. The Good -Great sound quality. It gets pretty loud as well. -Connection. I have had other Bluetooth earbuds where they will lose connection with each other almost right out of the box. I've used these for >10 hours total and haven't had any disconnects with each other or my phone. -Battery life. In the title these say 48 hours playtime. (NOTE: This refers to the act of recharging them with the case itself!) Some people were disappointed that the earbuds only last around 8 hours but that's enough for an entire shift at work for me so they work fine. They also charge really quick in the case. 15 minutes of charge gets you about an hour. -Secure on ear. I haven't had these fall out of my head once. I used to have just regular bluetooth earbuds without the ear hook at those used to come out all the time this set always feels secure. -Powering on. Simply pulling the headphones out of the case powers them on and pairs them together, very nice feature. The Bad -Case seems a bit flimsy. I dropped it once and the top came off, it snapped back onto the hinges just fine but it's hard plastic so I wouldn't recommend dropping it too much. -Charging cord. It's so small. Probably half a foot long. The saving grace is that it's USB-C so if you have a phone charger that's longer you can just use that. -Pairing the devices was a little odd. Instructions say that both headphones power on and pair instantly to each other. I had a little bit of trouble starting out. They both powered on but when I tried pairing them to my phone only one paired and i had to look for the other headphone in list of bluetooth devices nearby and pair that one as well. After that they worked flawlessly though. The Odd What I thought was broken was the volume buttons on each earbud. I pressed them both rapidly to go up or down in volume but it wouldn't change the volume. You have to press it once, wait and press it again, wait, press again. Overall they have worked great and any person that likes this style of headphones I would heavily recommend."
"June 30, 2021",Annie,4.0,,"The bass and sound quality on these headphones are excellent! Perfect for the amount I paid for them. I bought a pair for both me (green) and my mom (black) and we both enjoy them and how comfortable they are; even my dad wants a pair now too! Though I do have a problem with the announcer lady being too damn loud...when your battery is low, when you turn it on, when a call comes on, the robot lady is louder than your music, your call, everything. I wish I could hear my ringtone through my headphones too like other devices I own rather than ""INCOMING CALL!!"" paired with pure silence other than the outside ringing. I don't have problems with it other than that, the battery life really is extensive, and it's a good investment especially with the warranty. Never making the same mistake of not activating the warranty ever again, trust me."
"June 26, 2021",Bill,1.0,,"Everything was pretty good with these headphones except the volume buttons which did nothing. I  got a replacement item with the same problem. I'd give the product 2 stars, but the customer service was horrendous. I asked for something specific, instead of giving me a yes or no to what I asked, they took me through all the troubleshooting steps, taking over 2 hours. I finally jumped through all the hoops they made me jump through, only to have the volume issue remain and to not get what I asked for originally. A good product should work out of the box, and when it doesn't, customer service should bend over backwards to make it right. That was far from the case here."
"January 7, 2021",richard gagnon,3.0,,"for the price and quality. So far a good purchase, Also ""Won"" a free second set, with review ( NEVER received it) with offer encloed in box. The backup charger case doesn't seem to hold a charge on its own. Will inquire and update: UPDATE Amazon replaced first set: the case wouldn't hold a charge, and actually killed the batteries in the headsets if you left the ear pieces in "" to charge"" without being plugged in. Very comfortable, just a 50/50 I guess for charging purposes. the replacement works fine. No response from seller on my free one.:-)"
"February 17, 2021",Jason,5.0,,"After tried so many different type of headphones and earphones, I realized that hanging over the ear type is the most comfortable one that I often forgot its existence. My wife tried and also loved it and she is using it all the time, so I have to buy one for myself. I also want the function to stop the audio play from the earphone so that I do not need to walk back to my cell phone, and longer hours for listening so I do not need to charge in a week or a month. This product is the one. Very satisfied."
"December 27, 2020",NightRunner,5.0,One,"Sound Quality is very good and nearly as good as the Airpod Pros I tried out.  The battery life is between 8-10 hours.  People can hear clearly when talking on the phone.  For the most part, the audio stays synced when watching videos. If it gets out of sync pausing and hitting play fixes it.  These also are very light and sit snugly and comfortably for multiple hours a day. Areas of improvement - being able to view the charge status through the top would be great and the ability to be paired to two devices at the same time."
"March 30, 2021",mrright,5.0,,"I have been using TV Ears for years and like them, but I was looking for a wireless alternative that was cheaper than those.  These ear buds work well for listening to the TV without disrupting the rest of the house.  The bass is not very good, but that works well for TV, as I can understand the dialog much better without a lot of bass.  Make sure your TV is bluetooth compatible or you will have to buy the adapter, like I did.  See my review of the adapter for more info on this."
"May 21, 2021",Lady L,5.0,,"These headphones has been quite impressive so far. The sound quality is good. Unlike some earbuds they don't hurt your ear, They sit quite comfortably and is very light on your and in your ear .  The on/off and the volume buttons are placed where they can be reached without having to fumble or guess which button is for what. I'm still getting used to them however. I have not tested the noise control as of yet. And lastly, it connected very easily to my phone. Overall, I am very impressed. The price is great and you won't break the bank."
"June 4, 2021",Ryan A.,3.0,,"This is an item that promotes a free item for reviews, hence the large number of reviews. That being said, my first pair didn't  work properly. They did replace them quickly free of charge and send a free pair without the ear hooks which actually have better sound and noise cancelling. This pair doesn't have a very high volume but a consistent B.T connection. For the money and a free pair for a good review they're okay. I have learned that you get what you pay for with electronics. If you want them while working out at home of running, they are fine. Quiet places..... they will work. If you want something loud and with bass then I have no suggestions because I am cheap also."
"February 5, 2021",Billy McGee,3.0,One,"POWER ON POWER ON POWER ON POWER ON. That's all they ever say. I had to switch back my worn out old raycons, the sound on them is shot but at least I can anything other then ""POWER ON"" a million times. The sound quality is bad and they're very uncomfortable for long term use. Definitely wouldn't buy again, would never recommend. If I could return them and get my money back I'd be happy"
"April 14, 2021",TwinMama,4.0,,"I absolutely love these earbuds. I'm using them to listen to audiobooks while I take my kids for walks and while I do some crafting. They are incredibly comfortable and the battery life is phenomenal. But, unfortunately, lately they have been cutting out and I'm missing words periodically. It's happening while my phone is sitting right next to me so it isn't a distance thing. I'm really bummed! Not sure really how to handle this and sad that I might need to return them."
"December 21, 2020",The Grey Fox,5.0,One,"I have sent two other models ( from other companies/sellers)  back.  The others just weren’t loud and just by turning my head , would sometimes fall off my ear.  One model would charge one ear piece up to about 70% and the other to about 48%. This Occiam is plenty loud enough and STAYS on MY  EAR  !  Pairing was automatic..... I only had to select the model on my phone , and it paired in 5 seconds .  I can’t speak to the noise cancellation they advertise as a feature..... I just haven’t used it long enough.  But, for my short use ( 1.5 weeks)  this brand gets 5 stars."
"April 14, 2021",kboarderchick85,5.0,,"So far good only had them 2 days but used ghem on conference calls for work and a phone call. Bought them for running havent used them yet. I have really small ears and with the small ear nubs they fit pretty good, stays in and my ears dont hurt. One complaint I cant figure out how to get it to switch from my computer to phone easily. It seems i have to completely disconnect from one to move to the other. Hopefully I can figure that out."
"July 14, 2021",Madho Madhav,4.0,,"This is a good product and looks great. However, it is difficult to pair; instructions don't match the reality. i had to figure out how to pair it with each other and with a blue tooth device. Once paired it works beautifully with good sound. But most of the time the sound comes only from one ear piece. The biggest frustration I have is that while it works great with my iPhone but the audio output is inaudible in iPad3. So is the case with PC. Perhapd it is not designed to work on any other device but the iPhone"
"June 9, 2021",kwikitti,5.0,,"The earhooks allow these earbuds fit me perfectly right out of the box, for both my ears. I have a pair of Jabra 75t earbuds, and don't dare wear them out running because I can't keep them in place securely, (L one in particular).  These Occiam T17 earbuds are very comfortable to wear and the sound is great for use when exercising. Pairing is easy, although these earbuds can only pair with one device at a time, so I have to select the ""remove device"" option to unpair them from my surface tablet before I can re-pair them to my tiny AGPTEK A65 sport mp3 player. However, it's easy to use just one earbud, so I can keep my other ear open to listen to what's around me when I'm out running. Now I have a tiny, light, comfortable and easy to use sound system that attaches to me securely. Thank you Occiam!"
"April 10, 2021",Creatively Unique Photography,1.0,One,"I bought these due to all of the great reviews and have never been able to get them to charge, so I haven't been able to use them.... did some research on wireless noise cancelling earbuds and found some with a higher rating for half the price, bought those, they just came today, we'll see!"
"July 10, 2021",Holly,4.0,,"I just received these last week, and I am seriously impressed with the longevity of the battery. I had these in for 6 hours straight and I still had 70% battery remaining. They get a bit uncomfortable after a while. I do like that they actually stay in my ears. It is a bit weird that when you open the case, the right earbud is on the left and the left is on the right. When you open the case, it doesn't display how much battery life is left. You have to actually take an earbud out and pop it back in to view how much battery life it has (just had to open the case with my old earbuds). The connection when you pop the earbud in the case doesn't seem as strong as my last earbuds (you have to actually wiggle it a bit). I'm not sure if that'll make a difference in the long run. The case is very light, which I like. But it is a bit bulky, which is understandable for this type of earbuds. The noise cancelation is decent. I'm having a difficult time pairing my earbuds. I mainly only use one while I'm at work, but if I want to use the other, there are 2 different T17's to pair to in my phone. It's confusing. I still have to figure it out, but it automatically pairs to the one I use, so it works for me. I just hope these last, because my last earbuds (Vankyo X200) only lasted about 4 months and then wouldn't hold a charge."
"March 10, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I have been using another brand without the mic and it's time to switch around different headphone for me so I got this new one and it works well so far. I only have it today. Tested it on listening music and calling and works very well. It fits very comfortably on my ears and I expect it to work well when I do yoga without having to worry the headphone fall out my ear with certain poses. Dont know the battery life yet and hope it's as good. Good product overall. it's good for active lifestyle for sure.
"May 27, 2021",Bucketofgravy,4.0,,I use these everywhere. Even at home doing my yard. For the oeove you can't find anything better in my opinion and I own alot of headphones. Comfortable. Don't fall off. Sound quality is 4/5 battery life is really great. Taking calls I sometimes have issue with having the other person hear me. But I've had much much worse with every other headphones I've bought. These are my go too option. I love that they are magnetic to the case and it shows how fully your charge is on each headphone. Connection took 1 minute with no issue.
"January 19, 2021",N. B.,5.0,,These things are great. I’ve had ton of wireless headphones from cheap to pricey and these are a lot of bang for the buck. Would definitely recommend to someone who uses wireless buds for working out- I’ve had cheap headphones go bad due to moister from workouts and running in the rain. These hold up great and the charging case and the buds feel like a quality product in hand unlike other similar ones I’ve had. Would definitely recommend and will buy them again when I lose this pair like I always do.
"April 13, 2021",T. C. Lawmaster,5.0,,"As a ""full-time"" user of earbuds, I needed something that isn't cumbersome or easily ""lost"".  The over-the-ear feature helps prevent that very inconvenient drop onto or into a very inconvenient location - and at a very inconvenient time.  The charging case also ensures that I will have audio power all day - and for a few days.  The sound quality, during both multimedia playback and during phone calls initially seems to be well above average.  I've only had this device for a day.  I hope to be able to update my  with a report of long-term satisfaction."
"January 18, 2021",Sambar,5.0,,"Great form factor, charging case fits in my pocket, comfortable, NEVER fall off, can be used one at a time or paired, easy to pair, charge in the case multiple times.  Sound quality is good, although not audiophile quality, but great for the price, good microphones in either or both earpieces, I get about 8 hours of podcasts on a charge.  When battery gets low, (audio announcement) I just pop one in the charging case fr a few minutes, then swap earphones and charge the other, so no interruptions."
"March 1, 2021",Alaina,5.0,,"I’m so pleased with these. My first pair of wireless headphones and what a game changer!!! I had no idea what I was missing out on by ditching the cord. My job enables me to listen to music and podcasts all day, very long days sometimes and my fear with wireless was the battery life. I thought I would have to deal with them dying and then having to charge all through the day. Nope, no problem. The changing battery case lasts so long, I only charge it like 1-2 times a week and even then it’s never dead. The price for the quality on these is unbelievable. Highly recommend. I hope they last a long time."
"January 7, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,2,"the ear buds are fantastic but my case pin broke first day so now I have to rubber band it to keep case together.  Great quality and I like that it automatically connects when you remove from case, makes switching from phone call to ear buds quick and not noticeable to caller. That is probably my favorite feature, but i also really like that the percentage of battery life is easy to see. they are very comfortable to wear and don't fall out easy and I am in and out of vehicle 75 + times a day."
"June 2, 2021",BarbA,3.0,,"The sound quality was fine. I appreciate being able to use both or separately, which extends the use time. However, the battery life is poor. The earbuds have a self charging case. If I use the earbuds for a few hours and then place them back in the case for storage, the next day they have to be charged again. It seems as if the case drains the battery. Also, I receive notice of an incoming call but no other notifications from my phone i.e. receipt of text messages."
"January 23, 2021",Steven pierce,5.0,One,"Overall a good set. When you take them out of the charging case, they're already looking to sync. If you've already connected them with your device in the past, they're ready to press play within 5 seconds. You can use them together or separate. So one can charge while the other is in use and vice versa. I haven't tried it yet, but I think that if I'm using one, my girlfriend can use the other. At least, if she connects out of range with mine. Range is decent. 30 feet or so. 40 if it's unobstructed. They haven't fallen out yet. I'm in construction so I'm always getting shaken around or bumped or any other thing. They've always kept in my ear. My sweat hasn't shorted them out either. The charging case is cool because it holds power itself. So everytime you put them away, they charge. Plug the case in at the end of the day and it's good. Actually I only charge it at most every other day. But I also only use one at a time for a 9 hour stretch. Sound quality is pretty good. It's loud and clear. The bass leaves something to be desired but it's an ear bud so what can you really ask for. Overall worth it."
"May 14, 2021",Gia,3.0,,"I returned these. I did not get a really good seal, so the sound was subpar. I even switched to the L cups, but it still wasn’t enough. Because the hook goes over your ears, the buds would only go into the canal so far, and pop out. (I don’t have extra large ears. They look avg, 2.5” from top to bottom earlobe).  Only when I cupped my whole ear with my hands did they sound good. Otherwise, there was no bass or deep sound which is what I wanted."
"December 31, 2020",Jen,5.0,One,"I have tried a lot of headphones in my day and was skeptical about buying another set.  However, the sound quality from these is far superior to others I have owned.  They are comfortable, I actually forgot I was wearing them the other day.  They charged quickly, I also like the case and the way you can see how much charge is left.  They were super easy to pair to each other and then to my phone.  They feel light on my ears, even when exercising and jogging.  They stayed put without pinching my ears.  I have not had them long so I cannot say for sure that the battery life is great.  If it fails I will update my review.  So far, I would highly recommend these for daily use, during work, exercise, or just all day wear."
"January 16, 2021",Alex,5.0,,"I was a little skeptical of the warranty registration process originally, since it was supposed to come with a free gift, and figured it might come with something like this, an ask to leave a 5-star review. With that said, I purchased these for my wife and we have both used them over the last couple of weeks. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality and the general ease of use. My wife has tiny ears, so even the smallest ear pillows don't fit her perfectly, despite this, I still see her regularly use them. It seems her favorite mode is just using a single one to listen to the news in the mornings while sitting outside with her coffee. I personally love the stereo mode. I have had a number of over-ear studio headphones, gaming headsets, and mid-high tier ear buds, both Bluetooth and wired over the years, and so far these are proving to be an incredible value! The sound cancelling also works great! I would not be giving this product this review if I felt the quality/price quotient was not there. Do I still love my significantly more expensive over-ear studio headphones while I'm at the house? Yes. Would I like a pair of these if I ever need to go back to the office or listen to music in public? Also, yes."
"April 21, 2021",Tpat,5.0,,"These earbuds have good sound quality and are easy to set up and use.  I like the design that wraps around my ear. I find it very comfortable and don't have any issues with the earbuds falling out. I wear them mostly at the gym and when running and they perform brilliantly. These headphones have a really long battery life, they can last up to 8 hours on one charge and whenever you put them back in the battery case it fully recharges. The volume and bass are great and you can adjust the volume on the earphones themselves or your phone. You can also use them together or just one and you can take calls or listen to music. I had one earpiece have an issue with recharging but returning them was easy and they replaced them without a problem. I highly recommend."
"December 29, 2020",safetymom,5.0,,"The Occiam Bluetooth Headphones came well packaged.  The charging station works well and I like that I can use one earbud independently of the other.  They paired with my phone on the first try, and the sound is clear.  I haven't used them long enough to gauge true battery life yet, but I'm not sure I necessarily need to if I put the earbuds right back in the charging station when I'm done using them.  The earbuds came with three different size rubber earpieces so they are comfortable to wear and don't really pull on your ear as some earbuds do.  I'll write another review in about six months once I have put these earbuds through their paces, but first impressions say these are quality earbuds."
"July 14, 2021",Kindle Customer,2.0,,"These headphones are OK for light activity. Walking through campus or listening to a podcast while cooking. However, when I took them out for a run, as soon as some sweat appeared, the right piece started turning itself off and back on after a couple of seconds. This continued until I blew some air on it. It stopped for a while, but after a mile or two the problem continued. I finished my run with one headphone just to remove the annoyance. Sound quality is not great, but it's not terrible. It could use a bit more volume and bass. These really should not be advertised as water resistant, much less waterproof."
"December 27, 2020",nancy macintyre,5.0,,"I can't go a day without them now that I've worn them I love them, there so easy and you can have one ear in and they other one charging which most you can't or my last one you couldn't, I have had them for about 2 months now and I use them every day I love I can listen to music while I am cleaning and no one else has to hear it. I can wear them all day there very comfortable and they come with three different sizes included with a changing cable as well. I would recommend these to my friends and family"
"May 18, 2021",Steve,2.0,,"The charger will not work with an Android ""fast charger.""  In the troubleshooting video it says ""try the cable on something else, like a phone...if it works then the cable is okay.""  Well, if you are using an Android ""fast charger"" the phone charges fine, but not the earbuds.  This is a significant oversight in the instructions for use of these earbuds.  The user should be advised, at least in the video but preferably upfront, that a standard C cable with is required.  That is perfectly okay - JUST TELL US!"
"April 26, 2021",Cathy Dixon,2.0,,I really liked the way these headphones fit and the sound was amazing but after less than two months they completely stopped working.  According to the charging box they are charged at 100% but they will no longer turn on.  I had issue with them randomly attaching when I was using my bluetooth for other speakers so I had to always forget the item when I was done using them on my bluetooth settings.  Its disappointing considering how great the sound was when they did work.
"February 6, 2021",JAX32223,5.0,,So far so good. Had an issue initially attempting to connect and it appears that there are multiple attemps to reconnect the headphones to a blue tooth enabled device (android)  As soon as I replaced them in the case and then reconnect they work.  Not sure if that's the way to get them to work but other than that they are ok for what I use them for.  Wish the BASS would drop but oh well. They serve their purpose. Will give them sometime and possibly do another review.
"June 8, 2021",JayBee,5.0,,"Admittedly I have only had the wireless earbuds for 2 weeks but I have used them quite a bit and had no issues. They are compact, comfortable and they recharge quickly. I have not let the earbuds drain so I cannot speak on how long the battery can last before you absolutely have to recharge, but the base station  lasted several days without a recharge as it continued to charge my earbuds. Great value. I  would recommend. Also super fast shipping. Less than 24 hours. FYI: A nice feature is, each bud has its own power button so they can be used separately, the volume is preset if you have an iPhone( at least on mine) but you can use your iPhone to adjust volume manually, there are several combinations for pause, play, answer phone, etc. that you will have to try to memorize. (not a big deal though)"
"June 17, 2021",D. DeWalt,1.0,,"I have used a few different bluetooth earbuds over the past 5 years.  They generally last me a few years or I lose them.  I purchased these about 5 months ago.  The fit and sound were good. I generally use these for workouts and I sweat a lot.  After a couple months, one of the two pieces stopped working. Appeared it stopped charging.  Occiam sent me a new set. The same problem happened again.  They sent me a third set. Again, I've been using them for about 2 months and one of the pieces stopped working again.  It appears to me that two of the three times, the charging box pins were not all extended the same distance. Regardless, I finally gave up and am writing this review.  I'm willing to give a company a chance to fix a defective device, but three in a row that are defective is not acceptable to me.  Customer service was reasonable and agreed to send me the new buds each time."
"May 28, 2021",Your Pal Jeffro,5.0,,"Once paired, connection is seamless. Just take them out of the charging case and they'll turn on and pair. Controls are intuitive and adequately explained in the instructions. Works very well for phone calls with voice prompts and the main button will connect and disconnect calls easily. Callers told me they could hear me easily. The sound quality is excellent for the price. Not as much low end response as more expensive brands but A) they're super cheap B) comfortable enough to wear all day while doing physical activity and C) you're not going to throw a tantrum if you lose these or they get stolen, unlike those $300+ Beats or Bose earbuds. Legit company and product."
"March 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"They worked great the first week.  Charge held up well and the sound quality was decent at best. They have since stopped working and I when they do it is difficult to pair with my iPhone. The charge holds less than an hour.  For what I paid, it's not worth the return or trying to deal with their Customer Service.  I gave them away to the local thrift store, along with my other items.  I would not recommend them (even though they were recommended to me)."
"December 11, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,I bought 2 of these one for me and one for my husband 30 days ago. They worked great good battery life and great sound very few disconnects and I could hear clearly 35+ feet away from my device. Then one of my buds stopped getting sound after trying the trouble shooting steps I contacted the seller and requested a replacement and with in 1 day they had me a new set I haven't even made it down to return the prior set yet though they give you quite a while to do so but great quick service and I am very happy with this purchase.
"April 28, 2021",G. ROSAS-ACOSTA,5.0,,"I am really impressed by these earbuds. I got them to substitute my old ones - they were not holding the charge any longer and were not staying connected to my iPhone. Plus, they would fall occasionally while running. These new earbuds are a substantial improvement. They stay in place, even when I run at full speed, they hold their charge for many hours (I use them daily and have had to charge them only twice in the three weeks I've had them so far), and they have pretty good sound. I love them and am quite happy with them. They are also very affordable."
"January 31, 2021",Erin H,1.0,5,"I got these to work out with my Peloton because my earbuds constantly fell out of my ears while working out.  These work great for that aspect however, I got a faulty pair sent the first time that was previously used AND returned because it was faulty because when I got my replacement pair there was a sticky tape over the charging contacts for the headphones to the charging case (these were not present on the first set I received).  The left headphone wouldn’t connect to the charging contacts to charge without me pushing down on it and no it didn’t charge with the lid down.  Not only that, but while working out, the left headphone constantly turned off and on for some reason even when it was charged.  One star for sending a KNOWN faulty product.  The replacement pair is working so far but I will be sending back if I start to have any issues."
"January 3, 2021",The Joy,3.0,One,"As far as sound quality and noise canceling these are pretty awesome. Battery life is great too! Where the problem lies, however is the charging case- it feels cheap, and within 30 minutes of getting the earbuds the case broke- pin that holds the hinge in fell out. It still functions but it doesn’t stay closed and the lid falls off when opened. Besides that they’re great!"
"March 10, 2021",Spunkey1984,5.0,,"Love that they actually sit in your ear and you can move around and they don’t fall out. Have an around your neck LP Bluetooth but it started connecting and disconnecting so am having to replace it. Tried jabra elite 65’s but they constantly fall out, so I ordered these. So far they are what I have been looking for. Sound is great, and not matter what I’m doing they don’t fall out. Yet they ear hooks are so comfortable that you’re not aware that you have them on."
"March 9, 2021",Mark Yanney,5.0,,"I purchased these headphones for 9 year old son, as he was looking for something that would be portable, easy to store, and has a good charger. The headphones are stylish, amazing quality, and have a adjustable piece that ensures it stays onto your ears. It took a couple of seconds to sync with your bluetooth device (simply turn it on by holding  either button in the front for 3 seconds). There is a handy quick functional guide that shows you how to play/pause, go to a previous song, next track, activate siri, volume up, volume down and power on/off. I definitely recommend the Occiam Bluetooth Headphone - True Wireless Earbuds (T17 model)."
"January 28, 2021",Jordan Shelton,5.0,,"I honestly was a bit skeptical of how good these would be. However, these earbuds fit my ears much better than most wireless earbuds do and it seems to have good battery life so far. I dont think they are to big or heavy however they arent great under a hat and since its winter right now its slightly inconvenient to not wear a hat when walking outside but in the house or on a good day these are such a great buy. Definitely recommend for good budget friendly sports buds!"
"June 25, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,Update: The seller replaced the malfunctioning Earbuds with new ones and they work great! Like: I love the way these ear buds fit.  They do not fall off and are quite comfortable. They are very easy to work. You can control the audio volume and more from the Earbuds so you don't need to constantly get your phone out. Dislike: The sound occasionally cuts in and out while walking/ jogging. The ear bud for the right side stopped working after 5 months.
"June 2, 2021",Marti Davies,1.0,,"These are junk.  I purchased a pair in March and they soon stopped charging one side.  I assumed just a bad set. Ordered another set a few weeks ago and these have stopped charging on one side too.  The right side was also continuously “turning off” while working out prior to no longer charging.  Clearly I didn’t just receive one bad apple in the bunch since 2 have done the same thing. Not happy at all and Amazon customer service apparently has no way of contacting this company, seems pretty sketchy to me.  Don’t waste your money, keep searching elsewhere."
"June 7, 2021",Collin Z,5.0,,"First off, ear buds have never fit well for me.  But these are comfortable and secure, I haven't had any problems with them falling out.  When I take them out of the case, they are usually paired with my phone before I can get them in to hear ""connected"".  And, they sound is good.  Only downside is the main button is a little hard to push without pushing them deeper into my ear but I've worked out how to hold the body while I push the button."
"December 11, 2020",A. Powers,5.0,2,"Seriously, for the price how can you go wrong?  I had some of the well known fruit themed ones and they died within 2 weeks! If these last 6 months I could buy a new pair every six months for years!  They turn on automatically like the other well known brands. They’re really a good deal. I can’t stress that enough."
"November 13, 2020",Shannon E Dockery,5.0,,"I couldn't be happier to step into the modern era of wireless headphones. I am battery life challenged in all things cellular and I love that I can charge the ear phones and the case simultaneously and if the ear phones go dead I can pop them back into the case to charge without needing to plug in somewhere. I plan on using them on future flights. I'll update later if anything changes, but for now I couldn't be happier with the sound quality and the fact that they stay in my ears!"
"March 7, 2021",Udana Power,5.0,,Wow!  I LOVE these earbuds.  I bought them to do exercises classes at home via my iPad and/or laptop.  I have just paired them to my iPhone and it was EASY.  I found the manual on-line and just followed the instructions. The sound is great. I love how they fit over my ears.  And I LOVE the fact that I don't have to diddle around with a long cord. They fit right into my ears.  Love these. Also... there is a lifetime warranty.  Yay!
"October 27, 2020",FI,5.0,,"I've been using this product for about two weeks now, and below what I found: Sound for Music: Bass is good. I've tried a few music styles, from Jazz, Classic, RnB to Metal. Sound for Phone: The person on the other side can hear me quite clearly. However, I notice more complaints when using Whatsapp for an International call. But so far, the domestic call, regular, and VOIP are just fine. Battery: I consistently get 3 (perhaps 3.5) charges from the charger, for a total of 24-28 hours of use. The earbuds themselves can be played for close to 8 hours. A couple of times I used them for calls all day, and they worked perhaps 5-6 hours. Overall: For the price (less than $25), I found these earbuds satisfy my need and would probably get another set. I will continue reviewing and testing them for their other features and will update my review accordingly."
"June 17, 2021",Chloey,5.0,One,"I purchased these headphones in December 2020 and use them almost daily. I love them! I don’t think I could go a work day without them. Understanding that they have been under heavy use now, I have run into complications with the sound going out at random times. I contacted customer service for help with the issue and concerning the warranty. They were quick to respond, friendly, and offered a replacement for my original purchase. I am quite satisfied and thankful for the help! I will continue to enjoy these headphones."
"March 25, 2021",CT,5.0,,"Absolutely great product! Immediately connects, easy to link with my IPhone, battery has been great so far. I only use one of them as I like to be able to hear what else is going on around me. The battery lasts longer than 8 hrs, I use it all day in the office and it doesn’t warn the battery is low by the end of the day. They fit perfectly and don’t irritate at all. Using them for a week now. Definitely recommend them! A++ Update: using them for 2.5 months now, still awesome! No irritation, use them every day, all day… best over the ear earbuds ever!!"
"October 4, 2020",JoeDV,5.0,,"First, I really like the fit and feel of these. They're not cumbersome and the hook around the ear makes them feel secure.  The sound is very nice and the charging case is well made and holds them nicely.  Also, the case holds a charge for a very long time. Obviously, that would depend on how often you have to charge your headphones fully from a very low state.  However, the battery life appears to be quite long and adequate for just about anyone's needs. I appreciate that you can use either one or both.  If you don't want to break the bank and still get some quality headphones, these are a nice choice."
"November 23, 2020",Patricia L. Parks,5.0,One,"I like the handy case / battery pack that shows the level of charge for the ear buds and the case itself. When you  put the  earbuds in the case, they start to charge . When you take them out, they automatically turn on and pair with your device.  The controls on the earbuds to turn them on, off and volume control are pretty easy to work with. My wife purchased one pair and we liked them so much that I  purchased a second pair for myself. Unfortunately, the second pair had a problem and over 24 hours would discharge the battery on the charging case. I contacted Occiam by email and they  are correcting the problem."
"March 4, 2021",Crazy Tony,5.0,,"I absolutely love these headphones! They fit perfectly. Do not fall out at all, unlike those other most expensive headphones. The sound quality is amazing. The battery life really surprises me. Once the headphones batteries are finished, the case itself recharges the headphones since it holds a charge. No need to go looking for an outlet. The case can recharge the headphones many times before it has to be recharged. This is a MUST BUY!"
"November 28, 2020",C E Wright,5.0,,"So many things to like. Sound is very good. Comfort also very good, you are hardly aware they are even in place. Security excellent they stay put far, far,better than standard or wireless earbuds. Charging is a snap. There is an active indicator for each ear bud in the charging station. Also a battery gauge telling how much power is left in the charging statio. This unit will charge the earbuds on the reserve power or with the unit plugged in."
"January 2, 2021",NH Author,5.0,,"I had earbuds from another vendor. They stopped charging after 3-days. No problems with these. I got them because they have the 'bars' indicating charge on each bud. That is useful & works. I use them daily on my 2-hour walk. No issues at all. Very impressed. Also do a good job reducing noise -- in my case passing vehicles. They are fine even when a truck goes by. So, I recommend these earbuds highly & without reservations. For the price, they are GOLDEN."
"April 1, 2021",MargaretNRH,2.0,,"Purchased in Dec. 2020 because of high rating. Sound quality was okay and batter life was shorter than expected. One of the ear buds would occasionally disconnect, but a quick off/on would fix the issue. As of April 2021, the housing will no longer charge the ear buds, so they are useless. Since I pouchased in Dec. 2020 I am beyond the return window and I'm stuck with them. Will not buy again, but will look for a more quality earbud."
"February 17, 2021",James,2.0,One,"This is my second set of Occiam Bluetooth earbuds. The first set I returned and the second I've had for 6+ months... The batteries don't last but 3 hours max.... and the charging case might give you 3 charges. The case was a huge letdown.... the power meters don't work on either set... the case charge will drop down to 90% or so and then die. The earbud charging lights don't show the % of charge... when charging, no matter the charge, the bottom bars will all be solid while the top bar blinks. To figure out if your earbuds are charged, you will have to remove one and place it back... if the case comes back on, its charged. If it does't it means the case died on you. I can't recommend this product. It doesn't work as intended and it feels like I was misled about the charging lights. Noise cancellation is false advert."
"September 13, 2020",Scooter girl,5.0,One,"I read a lot of the reviews for these ear buds and finally decided to try them out.  I am pleasantly surprised with the sound quality and features.  Ease to pair up and the charging case tells you how charged they are which is very useful.  Obviously not as good as over the ear noise canceling headphones, but not too bad.  If your looking for a less expensive option this is a good pick."
"February 19, 2021",Kim H,5.0,,"Easy to charge and packaged well.  The best features are I can skip to the next song, use only one earbud, and the charge really lasts.  Can't wait to see how these performs over time.  Bought based on reviews. Update 3 days later:  Love these earbuds!  Stay charged for a really long time, easy to charge, they sync with each other right away after removing from charger case, are lightweight, comfortable and sound great.  Yay!"
"December 25, 2020",ksqrd,2.0,,"Got these for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas. Opened Christmas eve, needed to recharge mid Christmas day due to serious use! Sound is great for something in this price range, nice low range without distorting, mids are clear and distinct, highs are sharp and clear. while putting them away for the night just a bit ago the lid fell off the case! We found the lid but there was only one hinge pin where it clearly looks like there should have been two. I was able to get it back together, and tried opening it and it easily fell off again. Over all the case is the weakest part of these earbuds. the buds them selves have a good sturdy feel, the case give clear information on the status of both the case power supply, and the earbuds power supply, but the outer feel and construction appears to have been overlooked by quality control. Will send the company an email and see if they address the issue, if they stand by the product, I will increase my rating, if not, then buyer beware!"
"June 13, 2021",M G,5.0,,"I purchased two sets of these. My wife and I both workout.  They sound great, were very easy to set up and synch to our IPhones, and the battery life is excellent.  After a few months my right one stopped working.  It was beyond Amazon’s return window so I reached out to Occiam’s customer service sorta expecting no response.  Not only did I receive a quick response but they are sending me a replacement set!  Very pleased with these buds and their customer service.  Thanks Sammi!"
"March 8, 2021",Jpena,1.0,One,"THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT LAST... I was very happy with these headphones when they got here, nice sound quality, they are not extremely loud, batt is pretty decent, but right after the return time expired, the sound quality went to hell, sound is pretty bad now, you get lots of noise with the sound now and horrible  robotic sound.  I do not use them anymore, but i could not returned them."
"February 19, 2021",Dariana,2.0,One,"Got here pretty quick. Easily paired with my phone how ever, I quickly discovered that I could still hear my own voice over them at their highest volume which is insanely disappointing. The music sounds fine otherwise but I really don't want to hear anything over my music. I decided to keep using them anyway and after 5 minutes of use, the music was cutting off and on eventually just cutting off until I tapped on it and it came back on. I took my phone out of my pocket and it did it again. For some reason when I shook my phone it started cutting on and off again. Will be returning because I'm insanely underwhelmed for something with so many good ratings."
"May 3, 2021",Alex,5.0,,"I purchased these earbuds and was very happy with the sound quality. That's why I was so disappointed when they stopped working. I contacted Occiam's customer support by email expecting I would never hear from them. Amazingly ""Sammi"" from customer support answered me the same day and requested I send him a short video  of what happened when I charged the earbuds, which I did. The very next day he responded asking for my shipping address to send a replacement. I've never had this kind of customer support before. It's kind of unheard of. I definitely commend Occiam for their incredible customer support and thank Sammi for his most prompt response. I will definitely purchase from them with confidence. Way to go Occiam!"
"May 5, 2021",Jonny,5.0,,So far I am happy with them. Thay came almost charged so i didn't have to wait long to use them. The pairing went super easy and the sound is for my opinion very good. Has a nice bass and I only turned the volume about a quarter up on my phone and was loud enough. I can't say much if the battery last as long as promised since i just got them. Im very pleased and I'm thinking of buying them for my kids.
"March 10, 2021",Janice A Hancher,5.0,,"Been able to use these for a few weeks now. These are my go to ear buds. Sound quality is very good, comfortable in and around ear. Have not used for receiving calls so can't speak for that, battery life is excellent, use these for couple hours each night and earbuds recharge from case. I like to be able to also hear television so I frequently only use one earbud and sound is just as good as both together. Am very pleased for price. They fit in case easily and are very compact and portable."
"June 10, 2021",Mr Kidd,5.0,,I really like that they stay on my ears comfortably and the battery lasts for most of my work day since I listen to the GPS and music and audiobooks pretty consistently. For the price point the noise cancellation that it does give is noticeable enough that it does make a positive difference. At the moment though I am very sad because while working downtown I somehow managed to lose my left earbud and I am hoping to work with the seller on getting a replacement. I have started the email process with Mr Chen and so far he's been very professional and prompt.
"February 23, 2021",Dave Zamansky,2.0,,"Connected automatically to my phone.  Fits comfortably on my ears and the sound is great.  I have been looking for a quality pair of headphones that won't fall off my ears.  These are great! Update:  I am on my second set of these ear buds.  The first set had each ear bud shutting on and off during workouts as sweat hit them (these are supposed to be great for working out).  Occiam was quick to send me new ones.  These only worked a little bit better with the left ear shutting off from time to time.  Then after about 3 weeks of using them, the left ear bud stopped working all together and wouldn't even be recognized by the charger.  Occiam wants me to put together a video of their steps to correct the situation.  I have tried their instructions and it still doesn't work.  I am not sure I will send a video.  These cost almost $40.  I went to 5 Below and bought similar ones for $8 and they work just as well if not better.  The only reason I give them 2 stars is because when the earbuds work, they are great.  I would think twice before buying these."
"April 22, 2021",Skinny Jay,2.0,,"I use these to take calls at work, terrible sound quality.  Probably fine for listening to music, but they do not get loud, even on max volume.  People on the other end of the call can hear every bit of ambient noise and complain I have a bad connection.  You get what you pay for, I am very disappointed.  I cannot recommend.  I don't understand how they have such a high rating.  I am guessing there are many fake reviews here."
"January 19, 2021",Anita L.,5.0,,"These wireless headphones are a great buy.  I am very pleased with the sound quality for listening to music and voice calls.  The microphone is excellent too and provides excellent voice clarity.  The sound is a little on the base side but not distracting.  They style of the headphones look a little dated but I wanted something that would stay in my ear 100% of the time.  And, I can control playback from the earpiece which is super convenient when im exercising.  I don't have to pull my phone out to skip songs or take a voice call.  The headphones fit great in my ear and the piece that goes around my ear is super comfortable.  I can easily forget that I am wearing them.  The customer service of Occiam is tops.  The first set I received would not charge due to a bad port on the charging case.  Occiam promptly sent me a new pair.  No issues at all."
"June 25, 2021",Jordan,5.0,,"I've been through several pairs of wireless bluetooth earbuds and these are my favorite so far. They don't fall out because of the wrap around, the sound is great. The bass quality is always something I'm paying attention to when shopping for them and these have great bass!..did not disappoint at all. The battery life is awesome too..My husband used them one day and asked me to buy him these same ones."
"July 13, 2021",Patrick Green,1.0,,"When I first received these earbuds, I loved the style and fit.  The sound quality was also great.  That's where the good review stops! I have had these earbuds for almost 2 weeks.  I have had issues getting them to charge to 100%.  I have left them in the charging case for 48 hours and they are still not charged.  It's almost as though they didn't charge at all.  The charging case definitely get to 100%, but the buds do not. I also noticed that even if you turn them off prior to placing them in the charging case, they will automatically turn back on when placed in the charger.  That seems kind of counterproductive. Maybe I got a bad set based on the other reviews, but I will be returning these."
"June 5, 2021",Private,5.0,,"I love these headphones and the price. It still blows my mind I can listen to music, get up, move 2 flights of stairs, and can still listen to my music cord free. I love it love it love it! My husband gifted me with these last Christmas. Six months later, they still work quite well given its price. On occasion they do glitch and run out of sync or suddenly stop working, but it's an easy fix. The hinge to the magnetic lid to the case broke but it's not needed. They are indeed noise canceling, however one of my ears is shaped odd so it's not as snug as it could be. It doesn't hinder its quality. The little voice in the headphones also alert me when it's connected, disconnected, or the batteries are about to die. They're enduring through time, and if they ever break I will get these again."
"April 10, 2021",Demetrius Hayes,5.0,,"Sound pretty darn good. And the battery life is great. I forget to charge the case because the time between charges is soo long. I go days without thinking about it. AND, I've tried earphones before and they just slipped out of my ears when I trained. These don't. Soo far they stay in with very little adjustment. I think I'm going to pick up another set just in case something happens But, I love them!"
"November 29, 2020",Matt Murslack,2.0,One,"I really wanted to write a good review for these but in all honesty, I can not.  I've been wearing these for a few weeks now and every time I begin to sweat, it seems, the right one cuts out, repeats, ""Power On"" several times.  I take it out, dry it off, play with it a little bit, and then put it back it.  Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.  Now the left one is starting to do the same thing.  These are supposed to be sweat-proof and used during exercising.  I can't tell you how annoying it is to try to get these to work while still trying to keep pace and exercise.  I was so excited to get these and begin using them because for the most part, the reviews were good.  Now, I'm disappointed."
"June 23, 2021",Michael,1.0,,"*Sound not as good as MPOW M30. Have both, bought but wanted an ear wrap. M30 also fit in the ear better. This is not even cheaper than M80 *Easy of use poor--connection issues terrible. LED NOT GOOD as an indicator. *Volume issues when taken out of charging station. Very low volume at first so you can barely hear commands. Cannot tell if on or off. *Once connected volume does not work on either headset. *Confusing left right,"
"November 25, 2020",Lisa,5.0,,"These headphones are incredible given the price point and how well they perform. They hold a charge extremely well, sound quality is great as well as the comfort. Minor glitches sometimes when I’m out running but it’s once or twice max and it reconnects itself without any intervention from me. 2 second break in sound and then smooth sailing. Small price to pay for using them 6-8 times before needing to recharge the base and having zero issues otherwise."
"October 19, 2020",Klra22,5.0,,"Ok, so I bought these because apple air pods just don’t stay in.... That being said, these do!.... plus I don’t have to push them all the way into my ear to here, so no ear fatigue either.... You can use one at a time, which doubles the battery life..... Plus with battery charge display inside the box I k ow when to recharge, which for my use is about once a week.... So far so good.... Only one month in..... Will update later..... Hope this helps"
"May 26, 2021",Shermaine Gressom,4.0,,"I purchased these earbuds over a month ago...Initially I was QUITE pleased with the sound quality,  the fit in my ear & the quickness in which they charged.  I noticed over the past week that only ONE ear bud was charged & no sound came out of the other.  At this moment as I write this review, both seem to be in sync & working hence my reason for a 4 star review. Overall, I like them. Not sure how long they're going to last."
"June 17, 2021",Gina,5.0,One,The sound quality is awesome! I can listen to my music without having to listen to my boyfriend games. It nice to be able to leave my cell down stairs and still be able to listen to my music upstairs. The battery life is great and it tells you when your battery is low. The customer service is very helpful if you have any concerns or questions. It is a great price for a wonderful pair of earphones! I would buy them again and for any of my friends. I would recommend this to anyone.
"May 17, 2021",Doug,5.0,,"I have a tendency to wear these out fairly quickly, I use them a lot, but now that I have this pair I think they will be up to the task more than previous sets I have had.  The charging case displays are a very nice feature and the pairing process is super simple.  The instructions are easy to read and the buttons are easy to manipulate.  For those looking to not spend a lot of money on ear buds while they are active I do recommend these as an option you won't be upset with."
"January 23, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,The sound is incredible and they are so easy to use. Don't forget to disconnect earbuds from laptop to connect to cell phone and vice versa. I thought they were not pairing but that is because their memory will pair with last item used. Great bass sound and they keep their charge. They also charge very fast. I would suggest you leave them in their charging case when you first get them to charge for at least two hours. I bought another pair for my wife and she loves them!
"December 29, 2020",RCS,5.0,,I got these as a spare set to replace a bose sport plus set which are great but I find that these are way faster at connecting between devices and I can use them while gaming playing some fortnite with no issues.  They stay on and are comfortable.  I can have them on for an hour or longer with no ache in my ears.  I'm not too worried about noise cancellation as I like to hear what's going on around me while out exercising on while using them as a headset paired to my phone while driving.  All in all a great set of buds for the price.  Highly recommended.
"March 16, 2021",Sean Kelly,3.0,One,"Alright headphones, but there are much better headphones for less. The good: decent sound quality, decent battery life though I don’t think it’s 48 hours but probably somewhere around 40. No connection issues. The bad: I took a star away because the battery display always stays in the 90s until it dies. I took another star away because once the battery in the case dies the headphones stay on until they die even if you’re not using them. Another thing worth a mention is the case is the perfect shape to slide out of pockets when sitting."
"March 20, 2021",Michael Craze,5.0,,"These are by far the best earbuds on Amazon, and I've tried a ton of them. These are so good I bought two pairs. They are comfortable while wearing glasses and a mask even after long periods of time. They also don't fall out during physical activities. You can wear either earbud at a time to save on battery power. The LCD readout of battery power in the case and for the earbuds is a really nice feature too. These earbuds also use actual buttons instead of touch so there are no accidental button presses when adjusting the earbuds in your ear. Pairing them to devices is also super simple, and the audio when using both earbuds stays in sync, unlike some other earbuds i've used. The only thing I wish is if the earbuds could connect to multiple devices at the same time, because I have two phones and I'd like to be able to use one set of earbuds on both phones at the same time."
"November 5, 2020",Cheryl,5.0,,"This is an awesome product and the price is a steal!  I bought one pair (a different brand) for my daughter and we had to return them because one ear kept dropping in/out.  I replaced them with the Occiam Bluetooth Headphones-True Wireless Earbuds 48Hrs Playtime Earphones.  So far they have been great, they sound great, last a long time after charging and keep up with her active lifestyle.  We are very happy with the purchase and would recommend them to anyone else to try."
"January 23, 2021",Cris Strong,5.0,,"Very nice headphones , stayed charged off one charge all day ( 8hrs) at work. Very satisfied. UPDATE: After a week of owning these headphones, and being someone that has some of the top brands(apple airpods, beats pro, ect..) these  wireless earbuds have the best battery ive ever had experienced. I work construction and ive used these the last 3 days, all day (8hrs) without having to put them in the case to charge intill the end of the day. My case is now at 45% charge on day 3 of 24+ hrs of use. Really shows that the elites of this industry need to step the quality up. For 35$ my coworkers are blown away. These outlast the airpods of the coworker next to me 3 times over everyday. 😂"
"April 26, 2021",Jana,5.0,,"I very very rarely write reviews but lately have tried to do better. These blew my mind at how good they are for the price so I felt inclined to review them.  First, when I read how long the batter life was, I was a little disappointed; wondering if I could use them all day or not.  Well, I have barely had to charge them. I listen to them while cleaning houses.  I talk to friends and family also. It seems they use very little batter life. Just about every night I watch Amazon Prime in bed on my phone and use these as to not wake my hubby.  Basically, the battery is great!!!! Well beyond my expectations. They are comfortable to wear.  They sound great and my friends say I sound great on their end.  So - the take away is - BUY THESE! You won't be disappointed!"
"March 1, 2021",L. Turchin,4.0,,"Great clarity.  After understanding that I can connect to one device at a time and staying within that parameter, I'm fine with the results.  Very good sound, using youtube music.  Excellent for zoom conference calls at work.  Need to get used to disconnecting from one device and then connecting to another one to get this bad boy going.  Considering the fact that high quality ear buds cost $100-$250, these are a steal.  Good mic and good sound.  Work within the limits of the device specs-- for example:  unpair it on your laptop in order to use it on your phone and vice versa.  Not a multi point wireless thing.  But most aren't."
"February 3, 2021",Juan M Gonzalez,5.0,,"Great sound. Fulfills my needs. I had to edit my review. After, my right earpiece failed, I contacted Occiam customer service. They responded promptly and courteously. It felt good to know that the seller had my concerns and best interests in mind. Excellent customer service is hard to find. The people at Occiam stand out because they stand behind their products. I will definitely be a returning customer. Thank you, Sammi!"
"October 15, 2020",Terri,5.0,,These are worth there price !! I like these better than my past overpriced samsung earbuds. The sound is great. They sounds honestly better than any others i have tried. I like that these don't have a dominant earbud. So if u want to use either bud @ anytime it works. I have small ears & this style is great ! Don't even no there on after a short time. The case is nice as well shows individual charge of each earbud. The case is durable & not overly big .
"May 25, 2021",Ashauntae Clingman,3.0,,"These maintain a charge for a very long time. However they are not noise cancelling. I was on a plane with thre volume almost up to wear they hurt my ears. But I could still hear the passengers behind me. They also don't work well if you're trying to talk to someone on the phone. The other person can't hear you. So if you just need to listen to music and don't care about noise cancelling them buy. Also it's weird that when you open the case, the left earbud is on the right side & right is on left.  I gave them to my 5yr old granddaughter. I deserve better."
"May 5, 2021",Johnny V Whichard,1.0,One,"I loved these headphones originally.  They had worked as intended and were seemingly high quality. Now, the left side won't charge...and despite it seeming to still have some power, it won't pair with the right headphone."
"November 25, 2020",Sae Jin Lee,5.0,,"Well, as the title implies, these are my first pair of wireless Bluetooth headphones.  I have a Bluetooth single earpiece for phone calls but, thanks to these, I guess I won't be needing it anymore. There are two earpieces with guards for your ears so you don't have to worry about them falling out.  They come in a case which doubles as a charger.  The usb cable, that is included, is really short.  You may want to get a longer one.  Setup is a breeze.  You pair the headphones with your favorite device.  They turn on and connect automatically whenever you remove the earpieces from the case and disconnect when you put them back in to charge. They fit beautifully.  Like a hand in a glove.  They are comfortable, too.  Like a pair of your favorite shoes.  I'll use these, mainly, for listening to music and for that they are perfect.  Controls, right at your fingertips.  Play/Pause, skip track and volume with a simple tap on the buttons located on the earpieces itself.  Best of all, no wires.  Great quality for the price."
"February 10, 2021",KevFitz,5.0,,"My son bought these to replace another brand he had closed in the truck door. From the first moment, he has loved these headphones. The sound quality is amazing, and the connectivity distance is impressive as well. The charging case is convenient and easy, and the headphones last a long time; especially compared to his other brand. Would absolutely buy again. My younger son is saving up to buy his own pair."
"April 12, 2021",Richard Soh,2.0,,First pair I bought would not turn off when placed in the cradle resulting in draining of the case battery to 0 over time.  Returned it for another pair.  Same problem.  WTH? What is the point of the case being a charge if the earbuds will only drain it (b/c it refuses to shut off) when placed in the cradle? p/s  I've tried turning off the earbuds before placing into the cradle.  No dice.
"November 28, 2020",Rattler,3.0,One,Don't get me wrong this is awesome product I want to give it a higher review if it wasn't for the fact that every time I put the  the Bluetooth in the case  the bluetooth bounce up and down causing the case to charge them when already at 100 percent  the case dies really fast but other than that it works well for the price
"January 6, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I love this item. I originally bought this since I had another pair of headphones like these but connected with a string. With wearing a mask and having more strings, I wanted to try a cordless pair. Some highlights that I love: -you can wear ONE headphone -it automatically turns on and off when you take it in and out of the case -controls on EACH headphone -microphone works well; I use this to connect to my laptop and make calls from there too as well as my phone I was debating on getting airpods, but am so glad I got these instead; esp this type of headphone that has a hook to your ear and controls on them."
"February 21, 2021",Jeff,2.0,,"I ordered these with the intent of using them while running, the wrap-around-the-ear style is actually comfortable and stays in place.  The problem is with the connection,  it's not stable.  While running the connection in one or both earbuds will drop and then come back on.  This happened every time I used them. Amazon support wasn't helpful and the manufacturer was unresponsive to my inquiry.  So, this will be returned.  I would suggest you look elsewhere for earbuds."
"May 2, 2021",Phil Schroeder,5.0,,These have a decent sound and do well with noise canceling. Overall for the price they are pretty good. The only downfall is they don't seem to charge all the time sometimes i have to shift them around in their charging case so they'll charge. I throw them in my gym backpack and have found several times they haven't charged. They do have a decent battery life so if they don't charge every time it's all good
"January 31, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"I got to say i was sold on the idea of getting multiple recharges out of the case. I'm lucky to get 2- 6ish hour long sessions before the case is dead and needing recharged. Never from the get go did i get 8hr use from them. Never did the case fully recharge them more than 3 times to full. I dropped one of them from waist high after removing from the case. It shattered the back off on impact. Now i have no play pause, or volume control on that side. Long story short, look elsewhere to get something better."
"February 28, 2021",Mr. Hylton,1.0,One,"Head phones were decent for the price. The right ear bud dies significantly faster than the left side, regardless of if they're charged at the same time. Also I bought these January 16th and February 27th the right side shorted out. Haven't been able to get any support yet. If customer support gets in contact with me I'll update this review. However, I cannot recommend these. They lasted a month."
"December 30, 2020",Lisa,3.0,,"You can’t turn off the charging case, so if it’s not plugged in, it seems as though it loses its charge, little by little, even when the earbuds aren’t plugged into it. Also, when finished using the earbuds with a device, you have to manually disconnect the earbuds; otherwise, even if you turn the earbuds off and charge them in their case, you won’t be able to connect to another device until you’re manually disconnected from whichever device you used last."
"March 31, 2021",James Alan Jordan,5.0,,"I have not had these for more than a week, I enjoy using these to listen to music and history videos on YouTube while exercising, I have not had any issues so far and the ability to charge on the go by storing the earbuds in the case which functions as a charger works really well if you like to hike. I think this is a really cost efficient alternative to air pods. The company that makes these has a life time warranty on their ear buds which is really generous in my opinion, so if you have an issue you can get a replacement pair. When it comes to audio quality, it sounds fine, I am not an audiophile, I am a pleb I just want to be able to listen to what I want to listen to and these work fine."
"March 5, 2021",Orin,5.0,,"They pair easy. Not an audiophile myself, so am not incredibly picky but they do sound really pretty decent. Noise cancellation is fair, well enough to dampen loud annoyances, but, like, don't expect to sit next to a crying baby and pretend you're on a tropical island.  Have great connectivity indoors, but my one gripe is with outdoor connectivity consistence, they get choppy or drop sound intermittently.  Apparently that's going to be an issue with most all bluetooth earphones that are less than the most top quality, it has to do with bandwidth and the antenna bands that can be included into these small devices etc, so whatever.  If you're looking for outdoor bluetooth earphones, you're gonna have to scale up, but otherwise I'm really happy w/ em"
"June 4, 2021",Rob C.,4.0,,"I like the way the fit and feel. Much better to take on a run that something with wires or something that's going to fall out of your ear. Battery life is very good. I jog for about an hour a day and can't remember the last time I had to recharge them. Love that they charge in the case too. Sound quality is good. Only ""complaint"" is that every once in a way once in a while, one of them disconnects and reconnects randomly."
"May 7, 2021",Eagle1,5.0,,"I had ordered another brand and they had an issue with one or the other ear units not charging.  They seemed to have multiple problems and I sent them back and purchased this set.  They have been great.  Sound is good and they never cut out or lose signal like the previous pair I had.  They are very stable that way.  Very happy with these, I normally use them when working in the yard and such and they stay put on my ears very well.  They have not disappointed me yet."
"August 24, 2020",Thirty3,5.0,,"Love these headphones immediately out of the box. I've used ear buds where they sit in your ear and don't feel secure. These one's go around your ears for a great feeling of security knowing they won't fall out. Charging case is really cool and shows the charging levels. One thing I will need to get use to is the headphone case is actually backwards. The right earbud is on the left side and the left on the right. This doesn't hurt any performance, but something to note."
"January 21, 2021",bgt712,5.0,,"I’m really happy with these headphones. I don’t like the kind that just sit in the ear. I prefer this style that hooks over the ear. It’s more comfortable to me. I don’t listen to music with them much, so I can’t comment on the sound quality for that. I mainly use them to listen audiobooks, podcasts, or watching tv. For that purpose, they work great. I’ve been using them awhile now and they seem to be holding up well."
"January 12, 2021",Waddle,5.0,,"Originally bought another brand of wireless earbuds through Amazon but product did not satisfy the sound quality I was looking for and sound would come and go. I then took the task of finding another set of wireless earbuds in the Amazon store and ran into the Occiam product. I really liked the sleek modern design, had good reviews, sound quality is very good at this price and best of all, it was at the same price point as the set from the other bad brand. I am highly satisfied with the Occiam wireless earbuds. Will definitely  recommend them to my family and friends."
"December 30, 2020",L Wilson,1.0,13,"The sound is good but the batteries in the headphone and charging case die after a day, even when you’re not using it. I got them to replace another pair that lasted for days when they weren’t in use. Will be buying another pair because this pair does not have a reliable battery life. Edit: they have contacted multiple times offering refunds for me to delete my bad review. Their rating is way higher than it should be."
"April 26, 2021",klopikk,5.0,,"I purchased these because I worry about dropping a true wireless earbud and the hooks ensure that I will not lose one (or both)! I've gone through several brands of TWS headphones and these have the best sound and are the most comfortable. The sound quality is top notch with deep bass and clear treble. And I can wear them all day without any irritation. That alone is worth 5 stars. But I recently contacted their customer service and they responded in less than an hour and provided excellent care. You can tell they stand by their products and are committed to their customers' satisfaction. If you're considering purchasing these, I recommend you do it... You won't be disappointed!"
"December 14, 2020",Rodrigo Rocha Jr.,1.0,,"I got these at the end of NOV 2020. They worked well. Noise reduction/canceling was not that great but was good enough for the price. Does not fall out of my ear especially when I ran. About a month ago they started disconnecting & reconnecting repeatedly. I started trouble shooting, tried resetting them, deleting the Bluetooth Anna reconnecting connection, but even fully charged would continue to malfunction. Then only 1 side would connect, the other side continued to disconnect/ reconnect, so I started only using the 1 side that worked. Was ok for a day or so but then the other side started to do the same. So frustrating, would not but again."
"June 5, 2021",Alex,1.0,,Received a pair which I noticed had earwax in the earbud before I even had put it into my ear. Gave it the benefit of the doubt and cleaned and started using the earbuds. Decent enough sound quality and good at noise cancelling. Didn't recharge even when plugged in overnight and multiple outlets so obviously defective and probably why the person before me returned it. DO NOT BUY!!
"January 23, 2021",Zay,5.0,,They are really great. Works better than expected. They paired easily and are light and comfortable.  Most bluetooth devices I've used are uncomfortable and I can't wear them for long periods of time.  These are so lightweight that I forget I'm wearing them.  The sound is great for music.  They are also great for phone calls.  The callers can hear me clearly unlike a lot of other devices.  I'm happy with my purchase.
"May 27, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I'm very surprised by the high ratings these earbuds got. They do not fit/stay in ears for more than 20 seconds regardless of which cheap silicone tips I use. Secondly, you have to turn each ear on independently (though they will pair together automatically). The volume buttons on the earbuds simply do not work. Perhaps this is just an individual product defect, but still telling of the quality. They are supposed to charge in the case, but only one charges unless I hold one of them down forcibly. I'm returning and going with a cheaper pair that I know work. I just thought these would be nicer."
"February 14, 2021",David H,4.0,,"These head phones have decent sound quality and very good battery life. The noise cancelation is passive so depends on how well they fit snuggly in your ear. The volume buttons have a delay. Press them more than once a second and they won't work. I like the carrying case, it shows the cases battery percentage but kind of ambiguous for the individual ear phones. The blue tooth connect very fast, I like them but they could be better."
"April 14, 2021",James McCalister,1.0,One,"This headset caused me so much stress. It would never pair correctly and I’d spend 30 min each morning trying to pair it, unpair it, reset network settings, dpi bc whatever until it finally decided to pair. Or didn’t. And no one could hear me when it did pair. I got another different brand head set that pairs perfectly every time and have never had issues"
"February 26, 2021",vbri,5.0,,The battery life and sound quality is very good. I was impressed because these headphones are inexpensive and work better than my Apple AirPods. I purchased these headphones for my Kindle and I am 100% satisfied. I am happy with the battery power because of its longevity and the case displays the % of the battery power that is left when the pods are returned to it. The case is a little flimsy tho.
"April 14, 2021",Ter,4.0,,I like this product because it's the only ones that fit my tiny ears. I had a problem with the right earbud stop working. I contacted the company and they responded back quickly to the matter. They are sending me a replacement now how is that for service. I like buying from company who reacts quickly to consumers problem without hassle. I should buy from this company again in the future.
"November 26, 2020",Barbara Sauers,5.0,One,"I wanted headphones/buds that were easy/quick to put in and take out, had good sound, had sensible controls for mute/volume etc, and would stay firmly in place for running/exercise.  After considering, trying and returning a number of other products, these satisfied all my requirements.  The range of sound, including base, is clear and pleasing; not EarPods sound quality but not too much of a step down for the huge price difference.  The case is well made and the charging indicator is a plus.  The controls on both left and right ear are intuitive and easy to access.  Overall, I am impressed by the intelligent design and quality of this product."
"May 7, 2021",Les Nadon,1.0,,"Junk.  Would never maintain a reliable connection while riding.  Simply turning my head to the left, they would lose the connection.  Tried everything, repeatedly unpaired and paired then, would just never work well.  Never more than 4 feet from my phone.  Charging in the case was also troublesome, sometimes it works,  sometimes not.  Sorry to say, cheap Chinese crap.  Avoid!"
"October 24, 2020",Sam S.,3.0,One,The sounds quality is very good for the price of these headphones. They seamlessly connect to your phone. The charging case shows how much both have battery and how much the case does. The earpiece is a little large so smaller ears might not be comfortable but it is comfortable to me. They hang nicely in and on your ear.
"April 7, 2021",tigerlilly1282,1.0,One,Ok I have to be honest. I bought these to replace a pair I had. And was very disappointed the left one never did work and now the right one will not turn on at all I have tried to charge them and they will still not work. I am very disappointed.
"February 3, 2021",Paul VFR,5.0,,UPDATE TO PREVIOUS REVIEW; I've been a member for over 10 years and bought hundreds & hundreds of items. I've only done TWO reviews. 1. negative. 1. POSITIVE... THIS ONE. In my industry I am known for my top notch Quality Service... I didn't think anybody could beat me but these guys went above and beyond when I had an issue. They dealt with it right away NO delay. Just unbelievable support. NOW...about the product... I consider myself a expert on Bluetooth headsets... I have owned AT LEAST 50 DIFFERENT sets both cheaper and WAY MORE expensive (Like Bose). FORGET ABOUT THE REST. These ARE the best ones I've used to date. The call quality and noise canceling = EXCEPTIONAL. For me THIS WAS MOST IMPORTANT. Battery life VERY DECENT. The separation and stereo SOUND (EXAMPLE. Beatles Revolution.... Forget about it... AWESOME. Don't even waste your time with any of the others.  OCCIAM = Thank you for solving the biggest problem I've had over the years. 1ST PLACE!
"February 25, 2021",Carey Mom,5.0,,"Updated: These were out of the return policy, but I contacted the company and they were willing to replace these when they saw they were no longer working. The new headphones work great. I hope this pair lasts. Original: These headphones worked great from Jan 4 until the end of February. For the price, we should not be having issues, but the left ear bud no longer works. We are out of the refund or return window, so there is nothing we can do. I do not recommend these."
"December 31, 2020",Ahilder,5.0,,"These headphones work pretty well. The fit is perfect as I can’t seem to keep any apple product in my ears. Sound quality is good ajd the ease of charging is convenient and simple. It seems that sometimes the context of the ear bud in the case isn’t the greatest and doesn’t register to charge unless I push the ear bud in to force contact. Otherwise, the earbuds have worked well for running long distances (10 miles)."
"January 6, 2021",Thomas J.,1.0,One,"I was initially very happy with these headphone.  However, the receptor on the case to plug the cord into was made poorly and will not connect securely so I could not charge the case.  After 6 weeks I could no longer charge the case.  CHEAP!  Do NOT purchase."
"December 21, 2020",jeff a,5.0,,These are very comfortable. I have a small ear canal and the different size ear buds fit well. Most ear buds do not stay in my ear. these are easy to use and sound great. Update 5 months later: I would defiantly buy these again and have recommended them to friends. The versatility of using one or both ear buds really extends the play time.  The case also charges the buds quickly and multiple times with out recharging. The LED indicators in the case are very helpful for gauging the battery life. The sound quality is great and they are comfortable for long airplane rides. This company has great customer service! I accidently stepped on my ear bud and broke it. They  were able to replace the set within days. Amazing! These are great for the gym as well as traveling. 3 thumbs up...
"May 19, 2021",EmmyBee,5.0,,"I really like the efficiency of the ""kit"" with the buds fitting into the charger and an indicator of amount of battery left.  I like the overall quality of sound.  My only problem is that my ear canal is a bit too small for the smallest ear fitting, but that's my problem--the sizes would be fine for most folks. Once I get them to stay in my little ears, the sound is fine."
"April 15, 2021",MFY,5.0,,"I have tried numerous earbuds in the past, in an effort to find something that will stay in my ear, have bluetooth capabilities, and have good sound quality. I have been very impressed with these, in fact, so impressed that my son went and bought himself a pair as well. I love that you can use either just one or both ear pieces. If I need only the bluetooth connection to my phone, I will use just one. If I am out for my morning walk and want to listen to music, I wear both. I love the convenience and comfort of no cords. I also love the part that goes around your ear for more security. I have never had good success with earbuds staying in my ear. These are such a comfortable fit and the piece that goes around the ear does a great job of keeping it in place."
"December 15, 2020",BorbaR67,2.0,,"I received my item very quickly. However, when I opened the package, it looked like it was a refurbished model. There were fingerprints all over it, and the ""anti-scratch"" stickers were not stuck in the same spots. I connected the charging cable and it wasn't properly seated until significant pressure was applied. The audio is very muffled and the microphone picks up all the ambient sounds so you're unable to be understood. Returned them to find a better alternative."
"June 21, 2021",Keith Anderson,3.0,,"These earphones work great as long as it's cool where you're using them, either inside an air-conditioned room or when it's under 70 degrees F outside. Once it gets to about 85-90 degrees F, they start to cut out randomly. Left will cut out, come back, right cuts out, come back, both together, come back... if it's over 100 degrees the cutouts are more frequent and eventually, they lose their Bluetooth connection altogether. As soon as they cool off, they start working again. Unfortunately, most of my work is done in 100+ degree weather right now, so these earphones are useless to me. If you are lucky enough to stay cool all the time, they would be great for you."
"July 2, 2021",ANTHONY,1.0,One,I only had these for a little over a month but was only able to use them once. The first time I used them the sound quality was to low even at the highest volume. It was a bit noisy where I was but even with my other wireless ear buds by Bose I can hear loud and clear. I tried these out but after the first use they never worked again! No charge no numbers on the case no nothing! I waited to long to return so I'm stuck with a no working product. 😕
"June 29, 2021",brian stanich,4.0,,"I've had these now for about 3 months and so far they've been working great. Battery life is good, sound quality is great. I used them for a majority of the time I was in labor for about 36 hours and only had to charge them once. My only issue is with whoever designed the case for them... Anyone else notice the left headphone is on the right and the right headphone is on the left?! It bothers me so much! But overall I would buy them again. They're good."
"March 30, 2021",Kristin M Beckley,5.0,,"Highly recommend.  I run with these and couldn't believe how annoying it was trying to find a decent pair of earbuds that just play my music.  These were the winner - they don't cut out very often, stay on my ears while I run, and keep their battery life really well.  Good sound quality.  I threw away the last three pairs I got from amazon, these were the ones that worked the best. (I'm a real person, I paid real money for these, and no one asked me to review them)"
"May 18, 2021",Candiss Carter,5.0,,"The Occiam Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds paired simply with my phone and have been working great for my purposes (audiobooks and podcasts, sometimes music, while on the bus or doing housework.) They have fine base and treble, but lack a bit in the mid-range, which is absolutely fine for my needs at this price point.  (If I want great audio fidelity, I don't reach for a wireless earbud as my first choice.  That's what higher tier headphones or speakers are for.)  I compared dozens of varieties of inexpensive bluetooth earbuds and finally settled on these, and I'm quite satisfied.  The warranty offer was an unexpected bonus."
"March 26, 2021",Willie M.,1.0,2,Would not buy again. Left side went dead after a month. Threw noth away. Stay away people
"April 17, 2021",Cat J,5.0,,"I've had these for about 3 months. At first, they worked just fine. Now, they cut out a LOT. It's frustrating when your working out and the music stops. You think your getting a call, but then the music starts again and a few seconds later, it stops again. I decided to ditch these and buy something else when they stopped playing at the same time. Only one would connect at a time."
"April 5, 2021",JeannetteWeber,4.0,,"So first impression when I got them and tried them... Wow!! They are noise canceling. They sound amazing. Fits snugged in my ears too! You can’t shake them loose so that’s a good thing, because I never have to worry about them getting lost. I’m pretty happy with them. For the price they are great quality. You would think they’d be worth way more. They charge fast too."
"March 7, 2021",Wendy Cox,5.0,,These are great earbuds! I got them for my 10y old son specifically because earbuds usually fall out of his ears.. But these have the additional over ear wire (?) to help keep them in his ears.. (Sorry.. Couldn't think of the proper name for them lol) so these work so much better for him than your average ear buds. And to top it off they sound pretty great! Very happy with this purchase.
"March 26, 2021",Roderick Snyder,3.0,,"I bought these to have a pair that stayed on while bike riding.  That works well and the sound is good.  The only issues I have had are the case has come apart due to a pin missing - I have used these very lightly for about one month and the case now falls apart.  I also have pairing issues when I try to re-use the buds.  They pair fine the first time, but when I put them away (in the case) and then later open and remove them, they usually will not pair automatically - sometimes they do, but often I need to ""remove"" them from my BT connection and then re-pair them.  Frustrating."
"June 22, 2021",T,4.0,,"These are super comfortable. I sometimes forget I’m wearing them if I don’t have music playing. The sound quality is decent and the microphone works. I’ve gotten a couple of comments from people having trouble hearing me during a phone call, but every other time has been just fine. One other small issue is the multifunction button is a tad stiff. It might break in and get softer later on, but only time will tell. I really like having volume control right on the earbud. I ride a road bike to and from work so it’s nice being able to turn volume up or down without having to grab my phone. To top it off, the battery life in the case and in the earbuds are great. I’d give five stars if the microphone had worked perfectly and if the multifunction button were a bit better, but for the price these work great."
"February 18, 2021",Cynthia K. Danner,1.0,One,This is the 4th pair of headphones I ordered in less than 6 months. It's sad that you just can not find a good pair of headphones anymore. The quality is fine but the pairing process is horrible. The headphones stopped pairing altogether with my phone now and I can't even use them anymore. I would like a refund. It's funny how they stopped working pretty much right after the 90 day period. If it wasn't for this issue I would have kept them and bought another pair down the road. Please return my money or send me a new pair because this is ridiculous
"May 13, 2021",cmobs10039,5.0,,"I am pleased with my purchase and highly recommend them. The case is quite durable and seconds as a charging station. The USB charging cord is included, and the case displays what percentage of battery you have at any given time. The earbuds only hold a charge for 8 hours, so I charge them during the day, and nightly. For the price, and considering they have a lifetime warranty, I think it's a great deal!"
"January 25, 2021",Silverlyn,5.0,,"My first pair of over the ear, wireless earbuds and I like them! The earbuds fit well & they're light. Sound for audiobook narration & music were good. I have small ears and it takes work to find comfortable earbuds with good sound quality. I need to test out the playtime & comfort for long use. Seems like that will work out well and fit my requirements. I'll update the review as needed."
"March 8, 2021",Sox Fan,1.0,One,"I was told what great headphones these are, but they are awful!  One side goes in and out, I lose sound or voice randomly, sometimes I can't even connect to my computer.  I use Zoom often, so this does not work.  The battery goes out after 4 hours.  I would NOT recommend this item if you want them to work during work hours."
"April 26, 2021",Pacman,1.0,2,Constant disconnects. Volume buttons only work when they feel like it. Sound quality is poor.
"November 23, 2020",Ghia Mercado,5.0,,"I bought these because I needed a pair of bluetooth earbuds so I could walk around and listen to music while doing tasks around the house without dealing with wires or having to bother my spouse while they worked. These are decent, especially for the price. After about a week of using them I haven't had to deal with the signal dropping out or the buds falling out of my ears while I moved around, like I've had to deal with using other affordable earbuds in the past. Really easy to set up too. Random note, but I also like the design of the charging case--not *as* important (though i'm glad to see the charge levels of both earbuds, that's helpful), but just thought I'd mention it. All in all, pretty happy with these, they get the job done without hassle."
"April 6, 2021",JD,5.0,,Don't have luck with ear buds staying in my ears because they are so small.  They work great because of the hook attached.  Don't have to worry  about losing them.  The sound quality is great and the noise canceling feature is pretty good.  This is definitely great quality for the price.  If you are on the fence about these I would say go for it.  You won't be disappointed.
"May 30, 2021",Tiny Danzer,5.0,,I purchased the Occiam earbuds for ease of talking on my mobile phone.  I am very pleased so far.  The fit of the ear piece is very comfortable and the noise cancellation for these small buds is very good.  In honest I haven't used them long enough to comment on the battery life but the case is small enough to carry in my handbag and the buds can be recharged when needed. The earbuds are very easy to pair and I like that I have the choice to use either one or both earbuds depending on my needs. Overall I am happy with the performance and the product itself.
"December 15, 2020",Barefoot Quilter,5.0,,"I like how you can use both or just one at a time.  Just received today, so far so good.  Sounds good, comfortable to wear.  Additional info: been wearing a few days after fully charging.  Charge has lasted 3 days, it’s only at 75% usage now. Which is awesome. The music 🎶 comes through with a clear melodic sound and receiving phone calls, folks commented that they could hear my responses loud and clear."
"March 19, 2021",k,3.0,,"I wanted to love these but unfortunately they just were not comfortable for my ears and often when I used them my ears would hurt for hours after. The buds were just two big, I’m a 39yr old woman too. I ended up returning them because the pain just was not worth it. Otherwise I never had an issue with anything else. Only one time did someone say they couldn’t really hear me."
"May 19, 2021",Naomi S. Adams,3.0,,"These are great for listening to music or watching stuff on my phone, but the speaker doesn't pick up my voice well so it's pretty terrible for phone calls. Everone I tried to call said that I sounded very far away and was barely audible but the background sounds were loud and distracting. I do enjoy them for going to the gym but I'm going to have to find something else for work and calls."
"June 3, 2021",Nusser Malik,1.0,2,My 1st pair stopped working within a week.  The right ear bud went out.. So I got a replacement pair. This one lasted 2 months and I thought I wouldn't have that issue again. Then today the right ear bud went out on this one too. Also with this product the music cuts on and off. DO NOT BUY
"February 16, 2021",Shadow0429,1.0,One,"I was only able to use it one time, afterwards The Bluetooth feature in the earbuds quit working and I am now having to throw them away because I had them too long before opening the box up to use them, what a huge waste of money!"
"February 1, 2021",Leonard R,5.0,,"As stated in other reviews, these are very good in all respects.  They fit well, immediately connect via Bluetooth to each other and to my phone, and have clear sound quality.  I use them mainly for listening to podcasts and not for listening to music or talking on the phone.  So, I'll leave it to other to comment on that.  Overall, these are excellent in quality and performance for such a reasonable price."
"March 22, 2021",David C Morrison,2.0,,These Buds came the next day after ordering the first pair. they worked well for a week. Contacted seller and was sent a new pair in within a couple of days. the second pair worked for a little over a month then the left one started going off and on and finally died. I sent an e-mail to the seller again and am awaiting an answer. I originally gave 5 stars but have lowere it two stars  until I here from seller
"September 29, 2020",Michelle,5.0,,"I wrote a review yesterday that never made it here, so I'm posting again.  I think these are worth the effort.  Very impressed with the charging case and the stats it provides.  Love that you can use these independently of one another and LOVE the sound that comes out of these!  I haven't used them on a phone call, but my music and audiobooks are a joy to listen to through these.  Great volume and bass, as well.  I may buy another pair!"
"May 4, 2021",808 Scientist,5.0,One,"I've been looking for a pair of bluetooth headphones to use for zoom meetings and these totally fit the bill. Been using these for a few days now. The earbud headphones fit very well and other people on the call can hear me clearly. I really love this charging case. Only gripe is that the case for the headphones it is a little bigger than I expected. Otherwise it's great,"
"February 17, 2021",Alex B.,1.0,One,"I thought these would be great because of all the reviews of 5 stars. Turns out the only reason it's got 5 stars is because you could win a prize. But I'm not giving it 1 star because of that, no. I'm giving it 1 star because in the matter of 1 hour or so of receiving them the case has stopped charging the headphones. The case has been plugging in now for 2 additional hours and none of the LEDs are coming on nor is it actually charging the headphones. Save your money. Don't buy these."
"March 17, 2021",Nancy M. Smith,3.0,One,"The sound quality is good as long as you don’t turn your head.  When the battery is fully charged they don’t break up as much as they do when the battery is at less than 75%.  For the money and the amount I use them, I’m dealing with them. They fit great and are very comfortable."
"February 4, 2021",KaraCarina,5.0,,"This was my third attempt at medium priced wireless earbuds. (Hesitate to buy top-dollar ones because they’re so easy to lose.) First pair had trouble pairing and maintaining a connection. Second pair had trouble charging and maintaining a charge. These Occiam bluetooth ear buds are just right. I don’t challenge them for sound quality - mostly listen to podcasts on long walks/runs - so sound is good and fit is comfortable and secure. Controls are simple and adequate. Battery life is great for my uses. Charge lasts 5-6 days, while using for 1-2 hours per day. Recharges quickly. Have had them only for a few weeks, so can’t speak to durability, but highly recommend so far."
"February 15, 2021",BenJammin,2.0,,"These headphones are ok, but expect something to go wrong. I use these primarily as workout headphones, and within a few weeks, I had to send in the first pair I bought as the left headphone speaker started crackling and then completely failed. Amazon fulfilled the replacement quickly, but again, within a few weeks, I started having issues with the second pair inconsistently charging, or just unexpectedly disconnecting/powering off. I think it’s interesting that Amazon suggests rating sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life (which are all fairly decent), but there’s no prompt for how it simply functions, which is more pertinent information regarding these poorly made headphones."
"May 11, 2021",sagivo,2.0,,"There is no noise cancelation at all. The volume is very low and it's almost impossible to hear anything walking down the street. The microphone is terrible. Trying to make a phone call with anyone will result in pain. The headphones are not comfortable to operate, you need to activate each one separately. Sometimes the connection is lost for a few seconds. Avoid."
"May 16, 2021",J,5.0,,"These headphones are perfect for exercising. The over the ear loop holds them in place and is comfortable. Sound quality is great. Each one pairs separately and then pair together for BlueTooth, which is a little different but overall nice I'd you just want to use one. Charing case takes regular USB so it is more universal. Very happy for the price."
"April 1, 2021",Danielle W.,5.0,,"They stay in your ears, battery life is amazing, sounds is very good. I haven't listened to music, but for audio books, they Rock!!! I was looking for buds that stay in my ears. These are so comfortable, and you can use them independently. 1 wear engaged, 1 ear free to hear outside noise. Only compliant? No way to pause book or answer call without touching phone."
"May 4, 2021",Crawdad123,1.0,One,The right ear would not work out of the box. I have had probably 20 different Bluetooth headsets and I know when it’s defective. The case is too smooth and easy to drop. Returned for defective .
"May 31, 2021",LianneMigiano,2.0,,"I bought them to use while watching TV.  I'm 80, and hard of hearing.  I wanted to be able to continue to watch TV after my 86 year old spouse went to bed.  They do not even appear in the list of supportable products on my smart TV to pair with!  I do not ever listen to music - so these are useless to me.  They might be great for some music lover! I have thrown away all of the wrappings so I am stuck with these."
"September 28, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Very high tech cool looking headsets. They work like a charm. Great value for the money. I wont give 5 stars for sound quality because I have used very high quality headsets before and this is not in the same league but that being said these would beat any top of the line headphone when comparing sound quality per dollar spent. I have been using these over a month without issues. Wore them in rain as well and they still work. Battery life of the pouch is great however the buds themselves have to be recharged after every hour or 2. The primary battery life of the pouch is accurate but the individual battery gauge for each ear bud always remain at one level. It just tells you that the headphones are docked and charging not the actual charge level of each ear bud.
"February 2, 2021",Richard A,1.0,One,"Worked great when I first bought it BUT, it Stopped holding a charge. The unit in the holder says it is fully charged but as soon as I put it on it says low battery. This has occurred in less than 3 months."
"May 25, 2021",G. Nesler,5.0,,These are great headphones - easy to set up and use.  I really like the charging case they come in and the digital read out which shows both the charge left on the case as well as on the earbuds.  I've connected them to my phone as well as to my TV and the sound is clear from both.  I am impressed with these earbuds and the price was great too!
"March 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I've gone thru many earbuds and headsets over the years and this one is absolutely Superlative, in every way. You can use them together or singly (while the other one is charging) and the time on a charge is pretty long. I also found that the using the pair listening to music is a very good sound, one bonus that I didn't expect. In addition to all of that, they look neat and well put together. They are impressive. I expect to get a good bit of use with these earbuds."
"May 23, 2021",CaliGirl77077,5.0,,"I had to come back a month later for a ""real"" review for everyone. I was tired of buying bluetooth headphones that sounded like I was in a foreign land, or that I had to be in a soundproof, silent room to even hear the caller. YUCK! So glad that I stumbled across this listing because BABYYYYY these are AMAZING! I can hear pretty good with 1 of them in, but when I put both in it is like HEAVEN! The bass in the music, and the clarity of my phone calls is exactly what I was looking for."
"January 8, 2021",MrSept,2.0,,The sound on this unit is very low just like other newer waterproof earbuds I have tried recently and I must have tried more than 10 of them. The wireless headset I got last year that is not waterproof has much better sound in terms of volume and bass. Tried it for a few minutes and decided to return so cannot say much about the call quality or battery life. Also it disconnected a couple of times :(
"December 22, 2020",KCTexas,5.0,,These wireless earbuds are awesome! The sound is VERY clear and the volume can easily be adjusted even while you're wearing them. When listening to music they hold their charge for around 8 hours and I love the fact that the case can be charged separately without the buds in them and from that single charge the case can recharge the ear buds about 4 to 5 times without being plugged in again. I love the freedom these earbuds give!!
"June 9, 2021",Julia,1.0,One,"The sound quality is poor, the noise cancellations is nonexistent and I’ve only had them for about 4 months and they already won’t charge. Do yourself a favor; pick something different."
"December 7, 2020",Meg O,5.0,,"I have enjoyed this product. They are light, cancel out other noises well, and comfortable. These will work for talking on the phone but the other person complained about hearing an echo. They don't shut off automatically when put in charging case which really effects the battery life. Overall, I would recommend these and plan on buying a set for my husband."
"June 26, 2021",Andrew,3.0,,"First off they do not reduce background noise. Unless you have music blaring in your ears, you'll hear everything around you. Second, the buttons used to start/pause, answer calls, and skip tracks require a lot of force to press. You either end up pushing the earbud painfully into your ear or you have to use a couple fingers to support the earbud while you press the button with your thumb. One the plus side, they have excellent signal strength. I haven't had them cut out or disconnect on me like I have with other Bluetooth earbuds."
"December 28, 2020",Rhett Phillips,5.0,,"Great sound; I've had other headphones that just focused on heavy bass. These have a more balanced sound, which I prefer because I listen to all kinds of music and podcasts. These are lightweight and the hooks fit really well around ear. I really like these and for the price it is hard to beat. If I'm going for a long run or ride I don't have to worry about having headphones that are not charged enough."
"January 20, 2021",Shianne,5.0,,"I just got these yesterday and I couldn’t be more excited! I have tiny ears and can never get earbuds to stay put, especially while I am working out. I tested these out right away and they are perfect! They are comfortable and I had no issues with them falling out during my workout! Sound quality is good for the price you really can’t beat it! I had some issues registering for the warranty on their website and eventually I gave up. I figured if I have to buy another pair oh well! Not a big deal. BUT their customer service reached out to me and told me they were notified I was registering my product but never completed. I explained my trouble and they finished registering my product for me. I was very impressed with how helpful and attentive their customer service is. 5 stars all the way!"
"January 11, 2021",AK,5.0,,"I have constant struggles with most earbuds as they don't stay in my ear, even when I'm not exercising. These are fantastic, they're easy to put on, and the over-ear clip keeps them firmly in place. I like that you can use one at a time, and the case shows you how charged each is. I mostly use it for podcasts, so I can't rate the sound quality but I am very satisfied."
"May 6, 2021",James Parker,3.0,,"Update. Purchased on 6 May 2021. At first, this seemed like a great product. Sound quality is very clear. Battery life is as advertised. Great cost. However, after a few months of use. The earbuds began randomly losing connection and the left one only charges intermittently. Returning them isn't an option because of the timespan that occurred before they started acting up."
"May 1, 2021",dominic,5.0,,"What I like to so far ia the quality of upgrade over my others  is the battery life, the sound quality and the feel of the headphones themselves. The beat part is battery power the charge box holds recharging my earbuds and showing the actual charge left but the main part I dislike is the automatic shutoff so I can really tell id my ear buds are really charged"
"December 28, 2020",Michael Trulock,5.0,One,"Im getting great sound quality from these earbuds. They go louder than I can stand. They dont lose connection while playing music, with my phone in my pocket, which is a huge problem with every set Ive owned. I exercised with them as soon as I got them, thats what I bought them for. They handled the river of sweat from HIIT training, no issues. Once I got them adjusted right they didnt move. Great buy, will look into their other products."
"April 25, 2021",Peter,5.0,,"I have recently purchased at least 8 earbuds to test out. My main focus was to find one that I can use at work for meetings and calls. I ran tests on all of them and asked friends to give me feedback when I called them and this one won the  and love. The only feedback I wish it did have, would be a smaller charging box so I can fit it in my pocket"
"January 15, 2021",Phil Wooldridge,5.0,,"Easy enough to set up. I like that you can use either one or both together. I often like to walk and listen to podcasts, and prefer to do that with one ear open. Update after the first weekend: I used them both with my laptop and iPhone. Battery life is good so far, and after a few days of frequent use, I'm still on the first charge of the charging case. They are very secure. As mentioned before, I like to listen to podcasts and books while walking but also when exercising and doing household chores. Well worth the product price!"
"February 12, 2021",Unknownspud,5.0,14,The packaging is nice.  The instructions are clear.  I love how well they fit on my ears.  Very sleek but no worry of them slipping out!  I love that I can use them individually.  The case is perfect!  It is easy to slip in and out of the pocket.  The LED battery charge display for each ear bud is very nice.  Talking with customer service and they we quick to respond and fix my issue without question.
"July 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"As a musician with many decades of experience including recording at world class studios, I have very good ears. I have to say it is rare that a significantly less costly product outperforms another. These Soundcore ear buds are stunning! Their clarity and transparency was beyond any reasonable expectations. Their bass was full without excess thudding. Mids were transparent and clear and highs were not thin and proportionally clear. The definition was superb! These buds are so good I recommended them to my brother. I tested these earbuds against the Apple air buds (not airbud pro). It was not even close. Buy them!"
"January 4, 2021",Justin,5.0,,"I am not very finicky about my headphones - if they sound approximately good, then I'm happy.  These headphones work very well for what I use them for, which includes working out (they fit me well and don't jostle or fall out even when running outside), watching videos, and phone calls (whether personal or business, I can hear and be heard with no issues).  I have no problems and they work very well with all my products. The battery life is also quite good.  I'm able to do whatever I need for hours without the battery draining. Customer service is also great.  In fact, the first headphones I received wouldn't charge.  I contacted Occiam and they sent me a new set of headphones without requiring me to return the old ones. Bottom line - this is a great product and a great value."
"February 4, 2021",JC,5.0,,"These are more comfortable than my airpods. It's easy to forget you have them on after you're done listening to whatever you're paired with. Bluetooth pairing is easy as pie, unless it's paired to another device, which unfortunately  means, unpairing that device first. I love the case and its charging display. Has many features that Apple's overpriced artsy pods have."
"January 29, 2021",Kindle Customer,3.0,One,"I bought these to use at work, but unfortunately then I got them the right side didn't turn on. In the manual it said to hold for a few seconds....mmm, no try minutes.  Plus they turn themselves on and off while I'm listening.) So  the right one has worked for 2 days now and just stopped working. I know its not dead and won't even register in the charging case that it's there. I'm just so disappointed."
"February 3, 2021",Joseph Anime,5.0,,"I have a pair of Sony MDRRF985RK Wireless RF Headphone, Black. They got old.  Had them for almost 10 year.  They loose static.  So, I decided to buy these Blue tooth Headphones that wrap around the ear.  Had these for a couple of days. Work really good, and last long. Have not charged them for two days, and they are at 80%.  I will see how long they last when I use them."
"July 5, 2021",Mikel302,3.0,,"For a cheap pair of earbuds, these sound great. The Bluetooth instantly pairs and the buds pair instantly to each other as soon as you take them out of the case. They do get a little uncomfortable if you wear them for a long time. My biggest complaint is the charge level meters on the right of the case, they are fake. They don't actually indicate the headphones charge level,they just do a little light dance when your earbuds are connected and charging. For the money and sound, these are a great alternative to beats, raycon or apple."
"February 2, 2021",Jimmy,5.0,,This is my first purchase of wireless earbuds.  I borrowed a pair of a co-workers Jabra to have to compare.  The Jabra brand hurt my ears and volume was lacking.  These from Occiam don't bother my ears and volume was better.  These don't really cancel out outside noise but isn't a quality I was looking for.... these seem descent for a lower end earbud ( I wouldn't buy a more expensive brand anyway with small kids running around. Waiting to get their hands on them and either break them or lose them).  I would recommend these.
"January 8, 2021",Team Levine,5.0,,"Can’t wait to enjoy these. They come highly recommended by a friend and the Amazon reviews are excellent as well.  I’m just happy to not loose any buds that pop out of my ear Excellent they use usb-c now too Now that I’ve had them a few days, 1. The Most Comfortable ear buds i have Ever Worn.  Ear Wrap is very comfortable 2. Battery Life is excellent 3. Sleek design"
"January 2, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Love these.  I have expensive headphones, but forgot them at home.  As I was on an extended trip. I knew I would need some while working remotely and trying to be unobtrusive to others.  Found these.  I like the fit and feel better than my expensive brand ones.  I like the indicators for battery life and how they fit into the case and start charging immediately.  Definitely recommend."
"January 12, 2021",Celeste,5.0,,"These paired very easily and sound great! I mostly use them for audio books, but the clarity and bass are excellent for music, too. Most importantly, they actually stay on/in my ear really well! I love that you can use them separately or together and they have actual buttons for on/off and volume. My last pair (not Occiam) were so finicky I was constantly adjusting them to get them to stay in my ear and accidentally pausing my book in the process. Definitely a fan so far."
"June 29, 2021",Michael Cannon,2.0,,"These have suddenly developed an issue that cannot be fixed by following the support videos. The left earbud continues to state ""Power On"" and flips back and forth between playing music and saying this. I purchased these because I sweat when working out and they were advertised as waterproof. Just be advised when you purchase these that YMMV"
"March 28, 2021",Jerry,4.0,,"Sound quality is not too bad. Battery life so far is great. They are comfortable to wear with glasses. And the earbuds themselves feel like durable material. Would definitely recommend for the price. Update: I guess mine might be faulty, there seems to be like static that interferes with my music. Other than that, when they are working. They're pretty great"
"March 6, 2021",Joe Sutsko,3.0,,Having problems with the charging case. Put the earbuds in the case as instructed. They indicate charging for a few seconds then stop. Use the cable that came with it. Will try one more time if unsuccessful will be returning. UPDATE: the latest charging resulted in a 100% charge on the case which I assume recharged the ear buds. Will keep them for now.
"January 25, 2021",Ashton J.,1.0,,"I gave a positive review after being encouraged with the 'carrot' of getting a free set of headphones as a promotion. A couple things: the positive review was legit at that time but I only had 1 month or so of use. The 2nd is that the extra set of headphones never did come in. Scam? Anyway, after several more months the right earbud would intermittently not connect correctly. It would just say ""power on"" over and over again. The left piece would work but the right would not. Additionally, the led indicators on the inside which should the power available on the left/right is not clear. It just shows a bunch of bars but it isn't clear. Pretty bad product in my opinion."
"June 28, 2021",Kaye Spitzli,4.0,,This is my first pair of over the ear earbuds. I have had trouble keeping my regular earbuds from falling out. They seem a little bulky and awkward to get on but I’ll eventually get used to this. The sound is great and I no longer have to worry about loosing one. I really like the longer charge life. I’ve been using them for several hours each day and still haven’t needed to recharge the battery pack
"January 1, 2021",Nicole Wolf,1.0,7,Stopped charging after first use. Both worked one time then the left stopped working. Then both stopped charging and we have not been able to get them to work since. My fiance was excited to get over the ear buds for Christmas but I'm going to have to return them. Company keeps reaching out to me telling me they will pay me to delete this review. Very dishonest company...
"February 25, 2021",Kate Travaille,1.0,One,"I took these on a run and right away they fell off. I cannot use them because they won't stay on. Also, I found that there were too many needed buttons. I like the simple on/off and next track/volume buttons. Waste of money."
"April 2, 2021",devbadger,2.0,,I wasn't looking to be blown away by sound quality and feel like I had realistic expectations but the sound from these earbuds is pretty pathetic. The bass and mids are so muddy it is almost unbearable. Even messing with the equalizer gave no hope. Not sure if they are defective or just really THAT bad. These are going back same day after opening.
"May 21, 2021",Laura R. Charron,5.0,,"I use these earbuds at work and couldn't be more pleased. They are everything I wanted and more. I honestly can't say enough good. The batteries last thru my shift, the sound is superb even if I have to have the volume down, and most importantly for me -- I can feel if they are coming out of my ears so i don't lose them in a bad spot."
"November 7, 2020",Talyssa,5.0,,I really like these headphones they fit comfortably and stay on when I run. I needed headphones that clamp over my ears cause all the other one would fall out as I ran or sometimes just walking. Either side can be the master AND if you only want one turned on the other will work independently which I love. The charging case is sleek and compact the only reason I gave it four stars on the charging is cause I haven't fully tested the longevity of them yet. Over 5 🌟!!!
"May 29, 2021",Jay,5.0,,"So far, the sound is clear and clean. I do love the bass and the functionality is extremely easy. i.e., very easy and quick to pair. the volume and play controls are very ""finger assessable"" and they fit extremely well in my ears. I do not fear losing them or them falling out while moving or exercising. Again, so far-so good."
"January 20, 2021",Chuck W,4.0,One,For the money these are an excellent choice. Battery life is outstanding with a gauge to tell you how long to out. Don’t stay in my ear well. A little difficult to hear voices on podcasts and phone calls. I’d buy again.
"January 18, 2021",Adam,5.0,,"The sound quality and bass was excellent for the price, and the hooks allowed for a comfortable fit on my ear without them falling off. The only drawback was that when the charging port on the inside of the earbud is exposed to a lot of sweat or water, the bluetooth connection is briefly interrupted. To fix this, you have to take the earbuds out and dry them off with your shirt or towel and the bluetooth connection should be restored. However, this can still get annoying, especially for longer workouts. Fortunately, when I emailed customer support letting them know about this, they were super nice and offered to send me a new pair of earbuds with the charging port at the bottom where sweat is less likely to interfere. That being said, overall they definitely deserved the five star rating, and I would highly recommend this product."
"May 22, 2021",retired1,5.0,,"I use these to listen to audiobooks. The sound is clear and the batteries with the charger case last more than 10 hours. I like the hooks over my ears that keep the units from falling off. Amazon sells units like these under a variety of names, but they all look like they came from the same factory. Buy the least expensive."
"February 7, 2021",Erin M. A.,5.0,,"I tried 5 different pairs of earbuds and this was the best for me by far! They’re comfortable, fit well, don’t fall off, are easy to use, have a charging case, have solidly decent sound quality including base and they don’t have any bright led lights on the bud to make me look like a cyborg or alien or something. I set the rest back and use these every day."
"May 20, 2021",Louai Drissi,4.0,,The ear buds has good sound with good bass. it connects quickly via bluetooth whenever I take them the case. The only thing that I did not like is the case. it's very hard to open because the case doesn't have a rubbery edge to grip and open. I have to look for the gap in the front to put my finger in it to open. it's not a good design.  I wish they had  it in different colors other then black.
"November 19, 2020",Customer,5.0,,"I sometimes have a lot of down time at work so I got these to help keep me entertained. I wear one at a time and I'm able to pause my music whenever I need to with a simple press of the main button, no matter which side has the headphone. The battery life lasts through the work day with frequent pausing and resuming, with a break in the case for lunch. I also picked these specific ones because I wanted it to sit over my ear instead of in my ear canal. They're extremely comfortable and not invasive at all. I've been using them about 3 weeks and have charged the case once."
"July 17, 2021",Meghan,3.0,,"I bought these for when I go to the gym and for when I run (either outside or on the treadmill). When in a noisy gym or running outside: The sound doesn't get loud enough, the bass isn't as audible as I'd like, there's a lack of noise-cancellation, and the overall sound quality is mediocre. I bought these because they had great reviews for the price-point, but they truly don't hold up well compared to my MPOW Flame Lites. If you're looking for good gym/workout headphones, these are sub-par and I personally wouldn't recommend on the basis of sound quality. If you're using these in quiet environments and don't care about best-of-the-best sound quality, they'll be fine!"
"June 7, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Got these for my teenage daughter. She loved them so much she used them on a daily, nah an hourly basis from March until May; unfortunately, that is when the left earpiece shorted out. Static and cut-outs so much it became unusable. I contacted the manufacturer and they quickly responded (all via email) and gave me a full refund."
"October 28, 2020",Jereck R.,5.0,,"I bought these mainly for use with my phone while working at the restaurant. Bit of a hassle trying to access a phone when your hands are covered with some kind of food 70% of the time and having a bit of music is always a great morale boost during prep. Ear buds were almost fully charged when I had received them and paired quickly and easily with both my phone and switch with bluetooth attachment. They came with a usb to micro usb-c charging cord as well as additional ear pad coverings in different sizes that's always nice to have around. The ear buds fit nice and snug, don't move around as I'm running up and down the restaurant, and most importantly I can wear my glasses with them without the ear piece being in the way. Audio is amazing. Battery life is amazing, and the charger case fits well in my coat pocket. Overall super happy and I already have a family member dropping hints as to what they want for Christmas."
"December 1, 2020",bahtgunner,1.0,,"They hold their charge and fit nicely. I wish the bass was a little better, but the exposed buttons more than make up for that shortfall. Definitely a great value. I recommend for workout/run-types. Update: Left ear/right charge port doesn't charge unless you hold it just right. Yes, that means you get to sit there and hold it for the charge duration. Threw them away."
"January 25, 2021",KDL,5.0,,"I purchased this style because I move around a lot and didn't want the airpod style constantly falling out of my ears.  These have seemed to stay in great and are comfortable to wear.  I love that they connect automatically as soon as I take them out of the case.  Sound quality won't knock your socks off but I don't think anyone is expecting that with these.  The quality is good enough for me.  I haven't truly tested the battery life but have been surprised that after I've had them on for several hours, they were still at ~80% when I put them back in the case.  So far, I am happy with my purchase."
"October 3, 2020",Kristy Scheidt,5.0,,Love these ear buds!!! I can’t stand the tiny earbuds that Apple provides and they never stay in my ears so I always have to opt for wrap around. I wasn’t about to spend over $200 for earbuds so I went with these based off of reviews and price. So glad I took the chance. Just received them yesterday and they easily canceled out outside noise even with the phone volume at midway!!!
"November 7, 2020",Gregger,5.0,,"My wife has been liking the Occiam bluetooth wireless earbuds. She uses them while walking, running, talking on the phone, and watching videos on her phone. She has used several other brands over the years. She is petite, so what she most likes about these earbuds is the lighter, more narrow earpiece than what some of the other over-the-ear earbuds have. The other much appreciated feature is the charging case that shows battery life levels for the charger and each earbud. Overall, we are happy with the quality and performance of the earbuds for such an affordable price."
"March 24, 2021",Blinker Fluid,5.0,,"I use it for running and other bluetooth headphones needs. I like it because it stays on my ears and I don't have to worry about it accidentally falling off it becomes dislodged because it wraps around. It's decently comfortable and the battery life is impressive. I use it almost everyday 3-5 hours and I only have to recharge the box once a week, if that. I haven't really timed the charge, but it's super fast; I don't think I've ever waited over 2 hours for a full charge."
"January 14, 2021",Alan,5.0,,"These earphones are an amazing piece of affordable high spect technology, amazing sound and noise cancellation, it's amazing what you get for the price that you pay, they are nearly perfect! Key word, nearly, even thought these earphones definitely deserve 5 starts, my pair came with a little problem, the music keeps on cutting off every now and then I'd say around twice for the length of  a 4 minute song, i know I'll get it fixed when I activate my lifetime warranty so I'm not concerned (:."
"May 19, 2021",daisy jane,5.0,,I listen to music nonstop throughout the day and while falling asleep and mornings while drinking coffee and these headphones have lasted through the night for several nights without needing to be charged and the quality is excellent as well as the fit. My only complaint would be they could be a little louder but I’m pretty sure that would be an unsafe level of volume and too loud for most.. but as I have friends with the more expensive brand earbuds who have used mine and said they’re actually not much different the quality is definitely worthy of a 5 star rating and they perform honestly better than I expected for the price point. I’m very happy with my purchase!
"March 7, 2021",Douglas T.,4.0,,These have great battery life. More than expected. There is no noise cancellation but it never advertised it as such. I recomend these but my only problem is sometimes i take them out of the recharge case and only one syncs up . i have to power off the one ear piece. Power up and its all good. And thats maybe 1. Out of 10 times. I would still recommend
"May 12, 2021",Tripletmom,5.0,,"I am in love with these wireless earbuds! They are easy to pair and they actually stay in my ears. I've always had trouble with earbuds not fitting properly, but these fit perfectly. They also come with different sized ear pieces, so no matter what size your ear is you can change out the ear piece and it should fit perfectly. The sound is fantastic and answering a call through the earbuds is super easy. So happy with my purchase!"
"December 5, 2020",Marc,3.0,One,These need to be plugged in all the time to maintain the charge as it seems to me that they cannot be powered off once you place them in the charger case / UPDATE 3/22/21 case no longer charges the earbuds avoid these!
"January 3, 2021",Groomsie,5.0,,"Comfy and stays in my ear, no problens pairing with devices, stays charged for a good amount of time, nice case to charge and take on the go. I like that if you're not using the headphones after so long they will turn off to save battery, which has proven helpful. I use for zoom calls on my computer, pair with my phone for music or watching movies or have one earbud in while kids watch what they want on tv and I can listen to my own stuff, I also use for working out and sleeping. I use all day every day practically. This is my first ever set of bluetooth earbuds and I love em. No more cords getting in my way, especially with how active I am and my 2 little kids love to pull cords."
"September 7, 2020",Stephanie Bell,5.0,,"These Bluetooth earphones fit snugly to the ear, which is great for any activity. The color and design is sleek and nice, not to mention the battery display on the charging case is pretty cool. Sound quality is consistently great as opposed to a few others I have tried that would randomly drop in quality. The only problem I have found this far is that a few friends of mine have commented that my voice sounds distant/muffled. Still, well worth the price and the support is friendly."
"June 27, 2021",carissa,5.0,,"These are amazing, they have great sound quality, long lasting ( for those of us that can listen to stuff while at work thats important), as well as light weight ( my ears couldnt be more thankful), and the digital screen lets you know how much power you have left plus water resistant and affordable seriously whats not to love!!"
"June 11, 2021",Robert R. Harvey,1.0,,"These are awesome! I haven’t had good luck with ear buds.  These work fantastically and they actually stay in place as well. What a great deal, you won’t be sorry! UPDATE: After using for 3 months and not daily, the left ear unit stopped functioning. It will work occasionally, but then shuts off. Beware! You maybe sorry"
"March 18, 2021",Daryl,3.0,,My right earbud just stopped working. I purchased these less than a month ago and all-of-a-sudden the right ear stopped working. Aside from that the sound quality is excellent. Softest setting is still quite loud. (Update) replacement pair got the same problem. Right ear is going out and I'm 2 days passed the return window.
"June 14, 2021",Teresa L. Young,5.0,,"The sound is clear, noise cancellation is effective and the battery lasts eight hours or more.  I use them at work and while driving or doing things around the house and yard.  I would buy them again as they fulfill my expectations and they stay on my ears while busy. I would have one less volume level to be perfect."
"June 13, 2021",good work,4.0,,Good but not great earbuds. They connect to my phone quickly and easily each time. Sound quality is decent. I'm not sure why people say these are noise cancelling. I have some noise cancelling headphones and these don't noise cancel at all unless you count shoving them in your ears far enough to block out sound.
"May 6, 2021",Brandi M.,1.0,One,"From day 1 these never held a charge longer than 2 hours. Even at the highest volume I could barely hear over any outside noise. After 4 months the mic failed completely and all callers hear from me is a garbage disposal grinding sound, constant."
"May 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Very please the the sound and fit, they stay in place. My only observation would be that when the case is opened the right headphone should be on the right side of the case and the left should be on the left side of the case. The way this set was received was the opposite and somewhat confusing. If possible I would maybe deduct 1/2 a star for this."
"November 24, 2020",Daniel Cordoba,5.0,,"Excellent quality product, Last 7h 42min using it for Zoom Calls and listen to music during work, after a dull charge. The battery case made of good quality, I think it will not last a 4 feet drop, didn't test that. The Audio quality is above average , but considering the price tag it is excellent. In regards the pairing process, their is no pairing button since it is automatically, you must shutdown any old paired device when want to swap from iPhone to iPad to television."
"June 7, 2021",Margie Garcia Causby,5.0,,First thing did was activate them which was so easy and then I looked for classical music in YouTube and it sounded angelical ! I love these earbuds ! And I love the warrantee included which means I’m not risking any money . My husband love the sound so I’m getting a pair for him! Something I already love is that these earbuds stay on my ears and are so comfortable!
"May 19, 2021",Douglas Sykes,1.0,,"The product lasted about 30 days, since then the right ear bud cuts out constantly and progressively got worse, kept unpairing then reconnecting over and over, then it had to be re-powered on now it won’t even come on.  I have tried all videos on how to resolve, talked to a tech and now waiting on a response from the company."
"July 8, 2021",kyle L,2.0,,"Pros - long battery life, tells you the battery life in each earbud cons- sound quality was noticeably worse that the $30 sony earbuds I have. main thing was the prongs inside the case that charge each earbud kept getting stuck and therefore would not charge the earbud. kept happening on one of them, and now will not charge the earbud at all. probably only used a few times while working out."
"January 31, 2021",MrFlash,5.0,,"I just jogged 5 miles with and it didn't fall out, cool. Sound quality is impressive, ease of use is like wise impressive. One small thing, inside the charging case, the left earbud is on the right side and the right earbud is the left side, I guess design engineering had the final say and I'm glad they did, functionality is super impressive."
"May 30, 2021",Matthew S. Lalonde,2.0,,"1) The signal from my phone (that I wear on my arm while I run) cuts in and out constantly. 2) The microphone quality is really bad. 3) To switch paired devices, you have to disconnect from the earbuds at the first device before you pair with another device. Annoying. DO NOT BUY."
"May 22, 2021",Benny,5.0,,"So I was going to buy the Samsung earbuds + to workout in and saw good reviews for these and thought for 30 bucks what's it going to hurt to try. Glad I did, they stay in your ear comfortably 3 sizes, with hook around ear for sports. Sound is pretty clear and loud a lot better than I thought it would be. If you put it on a song that has good bass it will hit it deep enough for me, battery life and charging case work great, charge stays for least 6 or 7 hours. Really can't complain for 30 bucks too one of the best deals I got on this site"
"May 30, 2021",Brenda B.,5.0,,"These work wonderfully. The charge lasts a long time on each earbud (they work independently or together). Then the case recharges them when you put them back. They stay connected to your device, you can switch seamlessly between each earbud and they connect independently. They also stay seated in your ear comfortably. I would highly recommend these."
"November 9, 2020",gwynromero,5.0,,"I'm impressed. I've been looking for Bluetooth earbuds for a while and finally settled on these. I like that they come as a set, one for each ear. I love the battery life. I like that there are buttons for power, sound and play/pause. These have a good range. The sound quality is great and I like that I can use them to answer and talk on my phone. Highly recommend."
"February 15, 2021",Henry C,5.0,,"Nice set of ear buds, easy to pair and great sound quality. The arm is very flexible which reduces the tension on the back of the ear. The battery last a long time The charging dock/case shows the charge level when the ear buds are docked. Even though they don't come with the USB cable or extra ear cushions they're still worth the money."
"November 14, 2020",Chris,5.0,,"I was in the market looking for headphones that can accompany me for livestreams and came across these. The headphones are very easy to use/setup, the sound quality is great, battery life is amazing, case is awesome looking. Personally I like headphones such as these that have hooks for ear stability. With these you can answer phone calls very easily as well. I would recommend these highly."
"February 1, 2021",CBajoie,2.0,,"These earbuds are not made for phone calls and accepting incoming calls if you are on the phone. I love the fact that they hug my ears and are less likely to fall off, but it will hang up the active call if you try to answer an incoming call. My main purpose for buying the earbuds were because I am working from home and needed to take calls."
"December 2, 2020",Leochain21,5.0,,Ordered this second set for my stepdad because he loved his first pair of occiam headphones but wanted a different style. The sports style fits snug and comfortable so he doesn't have to worry about it falling out during yard work. I love that the case shows the battery life of the set so it's easy to tell when they need to be charged and when they need to be taken off the charger. Very affordable for the sound quality i would recommend.
"May 10, 2021",Jay,1.0,,I've had two different pairs of these in 4 months and both were defective. The first one wouldn't charge the earbuds so once they were dead they were dead. The second would constantly short out and the power bank would make a high pitched ring constantly and wouldn't hold a charge. In both sets the ear buds would randomly cut out for a few seconds and then come back. Save your money and buy a different pair.
"March 18, 2021",Robyn,5.0,,"I’ve tried alternative headphones that are Bluetooth and wireless with a charging case. These by far win and here is why: shows charge percentage for each ear, does not budge when I get sweaty at the gym, the controls are much more consistent with all Bluetooth and don’t annoy me because they are too complicated to remember."
"September 29, 2020",Jason S. Pang,5.0,,"Very comfortable to wear, feels secure on my ear, and easy to use.  Sound quality is excellent - I'd say comparable to Apple AirPods Pro.  Useful display of battery life for case and earbuds.  I really like having volume controls on both earpieces.  My only complaint is that the case feels cheap and is on the larger side, which perhaps makes it easier to hold.  For the price, you can't go wrong."
"June 20, 2021",Nicholas Fisher,5.0,,"These earbuds are the best I've ever used. I had decided to upgrade to truly wireless earbuds after my previous pair had finally died, and I was absolutely blown away by the quality of them. The sound quality is top notch, the fit is perfect (I can't tell that I'm even wearing them most days), they stay on through the most intense workouts, and the battery life with the case included usually lasts me an entire week. One of the best purchases I've ever made, 10/10 would buy again."
"May 10, 2021",Tom in upstate New York,1.0,,"The charger case battery quit quaking after 2 weeks. Audio is ok not great. I contacted product support twice, a painful experience, they gave me the runaround, promised to send a replacement. In retrospect they were probably just trying to run out the clock on the return policy. I woukd give 0 stars if I ckukd."
"April 11, 2021",tcole86,1.0,,"Very quiet. Volume buttons either don't work, or it only goes up to a whisper level of sound. Looks flashy and fits great, battery seems to hold decent charge. I cranked my phone volume up and held the volume + on ear piece and the sound is almost non existent. If I'm in a very quiet setting I can kinda hear music and videos."
"June 14, 2021",CG,1.0,,"This was a good pair of earphones, even though I did not like the location of the power button (it's on the side of the earphone, so you have to press it and it digs into your ear!).  The right earphone is completely not working.  Have to throw the whole thing away now.  I'll be looking for another brand."
"March 27, 2021",marmadmax,5.0,,"So far, the earbuds are living up to my expectations. Immediate paring and the ability to use only one of the earbuds at a time (mono) were features I wanted. Tried using single earbud for phone call, and there appeared to be no problem hearing on either end of the call. The storage box/charging case is a little difficult to open but that is a small issue. Overall, seems like a good buy."
"June 24, 2021",AK Eric,1.0,,"I ordered a new set of earbuds.  However, I received the earbuds and they are clearly used.  Returned promptly. Waste of my time waiting for them to arrive.  I am not sure of the quality, but they did look nice and the charge box was also nice.  I am happy with Amazon with their painless return process."
"May 21, 2021",Jaz,2.0,,"I like that these stay in my ear with the silicone loop. No behind ear pressure. However, I don’t like that I can’t control the volume with the earbud. The volume up and down do nothing when pressed. The volume stays the same. That was a big selling point for me, to be able to use the buttons for easy volume control."
"November 3, 2020",Domvaz,5.0,,"Great Product! Finally found ear buds that stay in my ears & deliver a great listening experience. Easy to set up & keep charged, not that you have to charge all the time. The price is reasonable for what you are getting. Shows % of charging on ear phones & % left in charging box. Great! You won’t be disappointed with this purchase. Love them!"
"July 13, 2021",Jon,1.0,,"I am fed up with these headphones. Running in the summer in the South involves a lot of sweat. Sweat would constantly mess with the controls on earbuds without real buttons.  I bought these, because of the real buttons. A couple of weeks in, the contact point on the charging connections corroded so that they would not charge. I clean them off and they worked OK again. Last night, the power button on the left one became stuck to the point that the bud no longer turns on. If you are looking for earbuds for long distance running, these are not your earbuds."
"October 22, 2020",brian C,5.0,,"I've been looking for wireless bluetooth buds headset to replace a pair(other brand) that lasted only 3 1/2 months. I've had these for 3 weeks and am very satisfied with the fit, the battery life, the ease of connecting and style. It is also noted that when you open the case, the led display shows the precise amount of charge currently in the headsets. I really like about how clear the sound is. I mostly use then to listen to music, the clarity and bass are great."
"May 23, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Seemed to work ok for a while then right ear started cutting out regularly. Sound quality while working was meh. Seal was meh. And then the right one powering on/off for no apparent reason over and over. Avoid. Boo bluetooth and boo Apple for removing the 3.5mm headphone jack and making us all deal with nonsense like this!
"July 1, 2021",RICHARD MENDOZA,1.0,,The volume is inconsistent. I also can't get them above a certain level any more that can really only be heard if the room is quiet. The volume keys on the side of the earphones rarely work. I've tried multiple apps to see if there was a difference with no success. I have to constant adjust them in my ear that's accompanied with a crunching sound that comes from within the rubber ear pieces.
"January 6, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"So far I love these earbuds. Great sound quality and  battery life. Love that I can use either ear individually. Edit: at first the head phones were great, but now they aren't. I haven't even had them 6 months yet. I'm constantly having problems with the other line being able to hear me. Although, I can hear just fine and use them for music, I bought them for the purpose of talking on the phone."
"May 14, 2021",Tlee,4.0,,"I've only had these a couple of days yet right away like that these are secure and comfortable behind the ear, that the push to connect etc is very visible and tactile. Many designs of other earbuds make it very difficult to 'feel' where to actually push to connect. I really like where the volume  buttons are located and connecting to a call was easy. My only complaint is not being able to hear the voice from the caller, although the caller heard me just fine; not sure what I can do to correct that. This may be the best earbuds I have tried."
"November 11, 2020",SNOW DOG,5.0,,"I was nervous about them when my husband told me that he ordered them for me. I have a small head and ears so I was afraid they wouldn't fit. When I got them, surprisingly they fit great! I love that they come with 3 different size ear buds and a charger. It's even better that the case is the charger and they charge while in the case as long as the case is charged (but doesn't have to be on the charger). When I take them out of the case they automatically turn on and connect to my phone. Sound quality is great. The only thing is it picks up a lot of my background noise when I am on the phone. People can hear it as if they are in the area with me. I haven't had them long enough to play around with it to see if it's something that I can adjust. They are great and ease of use."
"April 9, 2021",ClaireOKC,5.0,,"These have a nice grip (not too tight, not too loose) on the ear and fit nicely when I'm active.  I particularly like the recharging case, that lets me know if the case is charging or needs charging and if the earbuds individually are recharging.  I sometimes use one and not the other, and this works fine too."
"January 24, 2021",Nocam,2.0,,"**update** customer service tried to work with me and figure out where the problem was. Case still didn’t charge, so they refunded me since I didn’t want an exchange. They ensured that they’re working with another manufacturer- let’s hope it’ll get better as I know many people liked these!! ** My case never charged, it lasted me a while until the case wasn’t able to charge the earphones anymore. Now it’s completely dead :-("
"May 21, 2021",TSkin,1.0,One,"BUYER BEWARE!!  Run from this product.  Great sound, but that's only helpful if they both work.  Emailed company at address provided in manual -- no response.  Manual said reaching out via Amazon might be faster.  Tried that.  No response.  More garbage from Amazon sellers.  Why don't they do something about this?"
"January 14, 2021",Integrationation,5.0,,"The item works as described. The sound quality is good.  The noise cancellation is good.  Where the product really stand out is battery life.  Even when the carrying case isn’t plugged in, the earbuds charge in there case when the case battery life is charged.  Also, the ease at which the item pairs and turns off automatically is a huge plus."
"February 27, 2021",Jesse Snowden,5.0,,I work in industrial construction and needed headphones that wouldn't fall out and also work as earplugs. These are awesome! The battery always outlasts my phone's battery and I walk by a guy with a rotahammer or a chop saw cutting steel studs and my ears are protected. Absolutely flawless operation and they never fall off.
"January 30, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"So far I have had a great experience with my earbuds paired with my Samsung Galaxay A50. I'm no sound quality enthusiast. I use the earbuds mostly to drown out office chatter and to exercise. I like hip hop and they have good base and clarity without having to have the volume in the red level. The auto pairing is awesome. It's great that I can use one earbud at time if desired. Mic is good for phone conversations. And you can beat the charging case. Because you can use the earbuds while the case is charging, you feel like never have to charge the earbuds. For exercising the ear hook keeps them in place with no worries of them falling out and having the controls on the earbuds is awesome."
"June 8, 2021",Erin,5.0,,"They connect super fast. I only use one ear at a time. The only problem is that my phone doesn’t tell me in Bluetooth which is R and which is L. But they don’t fall off your ear, they sound pretty good for the price and, honestly, what’s not to love? We’ll see how long they last."
"July 8, 2021",DeeMar,1.0,,"Within ONE WEEK, these have already become unusable for me. The audio cuts out constantly. Every aspect of this product is total trash, and I will never purchase an Occiam product. Apparently they email people who receive defective products like I did, and instead of offering an outright refund like an ethical company would, they ask that you change your review to 5 stars first. Do not support this company."
"January 25, 2021",2017RTP,2.0,,So these are comfortable to wear until you want to push the play/pause button. You have to press it so hard that it shoves the ear piece deep into your ear causing very uncomfortable pressure. My ears are still throbbing from trying it. You have to take the entire thing off to press the pause button. Very poor design flaw. Other than that sound quality is good.
"March 18, 2021",Ryan Cosby,5.0,,"I got these mainly to replace my old in ear ear buds, they always seems to slip out and fall on the ground. With the Occiam earphones, they stay attached to my ear nicely since they hook around the ear and don't fall out. The only reason that I opted for a 5 star since they don't have half stars, only because they are not IP rated but I knew that going into the purchase, hence 5 star for what they are. The sound quality is good and they have decent low end sound to them. I haven't owned them long but they seem durable and well constructed."
"March 8, 2021",E. Minor,5.0,,"These headphones were exactly what I was looking for. If you’re looking for a bass these are not the headphones for you. If you’re looking for headphones to listen to music while out on a walk or a jog they are perfect. The battery life is exceptional and I love the clips so I don’t have to worry about them falling out of my ears. My right earbud did die and it no longer works. Why did I give it five, The customer service is exceptional. I reached out to them and explained what happened to my headphones. After going through a series of tests we determined that the headphone just wouldn’t work anymore. The customer service was awesome and I should receive a new pair soon. Thank you Sammi Chen😁😁😁😁"
"February 1, 2021",Charles I.,5.0,,"So far the battery life has been very good, but most importantly I'm no longer fussing with my true wireless earbuds to keep them in my ears.  Don't know what's different about my ears, but the previous set of TWEs I had would work themselves out no matter what size tips I put on or how hard I jammed them in.  I haven't had these new ones fall out even once.  I do notice a bit of a click/pop in one of them when I'm jogging; not sure if it's something with my ear or with these TWEs though.  A good purchase at a reasonable price.  Ones from Beats that look almost the same cost 5x as much.  But we'll see how these hold-up long-term as friends with Beats maintain that both the quality and sound are worth the extra $$$."
"November 23, 2020",Sara,5.0,,"I had a little trouble with pairing these to my phone, but once I finally got them to do that they are great. I wanted a pair of truly wireless headphones for work and these are just the thing. They sound great and I like the one-ear feature because I can only use I one earbud when I'm at work. Overall a good pair of headphones for the price."
"October 12, 2020",rosallyn hernandez,5.0,27,"When I thought I lost my AirPods. I decided to come on Amazon again. Never fails. Listen to the reviews! These are dope, fit great, feel great, are a lot more stable in your ear compared to AirPods, volume is awesome. I can’t hear anything other than this banging music!! I’m happy!"
"October 17, 2020",Roberta Newman,5.0,,These are just what I was looking for! My kid is doing remote learning and we needs a nice pair of ear buds. One she can wear and one I can wear. They fit her little ear great and mine as well. The sound is great and nice and clear in both ends. Her teacher even asked for the link for these as the sound was so very clear. I highly recommend these if your looking for a good pair.
"April 16, 2021",BSquare,5.0,,I absolutely love these. I have a hard time keeping things in my ears but these fits so well and I almost don't even realize it's there. I'm giving them 5 stars because they work so well if the durability changes I will command and update.  They connect easily and paired easily. All around they are great
"May 27, 2021",Josh,4.0,,"Only downsides I've found so far: -Sometimes if you're not careful, e.g. waiting until you're in a very busy gym to turn them on and connect, people might connect to your headphones by accident.  I think this is a flaw of most bluetooth earbuds AFAIK. -No way to tell the earbuds what devices should be a priority, but not a big deal either. -The ear grabbers aren't the strongest.  If you're doing more dramatic movements e.g. karate, dancing, trail running, etc. they COULD fall out."
"February 22, 2021",pharcyde,5.0,,"Headsets connected fine arrived on time great product. The reason I purchased these headsets are the fact they go over your ear as compared to other brands that plug into your ear, I don't have to worry about this headsets falling out. Win, win for me. Headset battery is great quick 15 minutes recharge keeps me going."
"February 7, 2021",C. Murphy,4.0,,So far so good. I've never had wireless buds before but I am happy with the sound. Use them mainly for walking or when I'm on the treadmill watching a video on my phone or with music. Can't comment on battery life since I'm not a heavy user but the case charger is convenient and they connect to my phone as soon as I put them on. Good purchase.
"June 27, 2021",Jeremiah M.,4.0,,"Had to clear out five no longer in use bluetooth devices from my phone, including this earbud pair.  These earbuds were cutting out in one or both buds, frequently.  Amazon customer service said to also ""forget"" this pair.  So I did all that and repaired, and they no longer cut out on volume."
"June 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"I was hoping these earbuds worked as well as my other bluetooth earbuds (wired together but wireless connection) worked, but that is not the case.  I use primarily for listening to podcasts/music, and phone and Zoom calls.  The listening part has been perfectly fine, aside from intermittent time when the audio unbalances between the two buds (but it usually quickly corrects itself), but the main problem is phone and Zoom calls (connected through my laptop).  About half the time the person/people I speak to say my voice is hollow and too low.  There seems to be no rhyme or reason to it, it just happens periodically.  I wish this could be fixed because I love the product concept."
"December 29, 2020",jim cammack,2.0,,"Battery life was really short after a short time.  I didn't realize the 48hrs is only if you place them back in the charging box, even without the charger into the wall.  But still no where near 8 hrs without doing that.  In 30 mins or an hour on the phone they are dead.  Sound/mic quality are average.  Better than other mics in not being overly sensitive and doesn't pick up too much ambient and extraneous noises.  Nice secure feel with the ear guard albeit once my ears get used to them...initially hurt after 30 mins in, but over time that improves.  Good that it's not the small ones that I can't hold on to or that have no way to stay secure in ears.  USB-C is a plus for now that is same as my phone and other devices, convenient to always have one on hand."
"May 22, 2021",Mark L,1.0,One,"Far too often, these earbuds don’t work. The left earbud frequently turns off when I adjust it in my ear. I don’t touch any buttons. All I do is reposition it in my ear. After it turns off, I will randomly hear ‘Power On’ several times. So frustrating. This past week, the right earbud stopped charging so it’s completely useless. My wife has earbuds from a competitor. She loves them. Same price point. I’m going to buy a pair of those."
"May 29, 2021",RedBlueFox,5.0,,"Best pair of wireless earbuds I've used. The ear loop helps keep them on my ears through heavy lifting at work. A much cheaper pair from another brand kept falling off my ear. This stays on, and it's a big deal for me lol.  Battery life is excellent as well. Will update if something goes awry."
"July 9, 2021",Nicole,3.0,,"These are alright. My main issue, is that that volume buttons don't always work. They are fairly comfortable, they're just a little loose on me. I feel like they might fall out while I'm jogging. Overall sound quality is decent and I haven't had any Bluetooth connection issues yet."
"May 10, 2021",wanda medlock,3.0,,Don’t know if I like it or not.  In order to get the warranty they required that I review it. So I just randomly reviewed it fir the warranty.  I have yet to use them. Update:  Company assured me that they don’t require a review for their warranty.  I received an email to that fact although the information inside the product states what I put in the initial review. The product so far had been very good and no complaints.
"March 26, 2021",Jackie,5.0,,These have great battery life and you can leave only one in and the other plugged in the case and it will only play in the one earbud. Bass is really good and the sound quality is great. I love the clip because it doesn't move around on my ear and I can sprint on the treadmill if I want and it doesn't come off or come loose.  Would highly recommend!
"July 12, 2021",alex rhode,3.0,,"These headphones sound very good for listen to music and podcasts, and have good noise cancelling qualities, but after only 30 days of use, one of the headphones is not charging properly, so while one headphone lasts for hours, the other ‘powers off’ after 30 minutes. My second complaint is that these headphones do NOT work well at all for phone calls. The description says there is a microphone, but no one can hear me when I try to use these headphones as a headset for phone calls. I can hear them, but they can not here me. I will not purchase these again."
"April 27, 2021",Carvin,5.0,,Excellent product long battery life and you can walk a long distance and still get signal. Fast shipping. I enjoyed mine so much I bought one for my wife. Ok here's a update from my previous post. I'm still happy with this product. But for those who receive the you win a free pair. It's legit I got mine a week later. The pair on the left is the free pair. Never own a pair that just stick in you ear. But with us having to wear mask everywhere. Those may be more functional because they won't get stuck in the string of the mask. When you try and take the mask off. I highly recommend this to anyone one the fence. Company and product are great. And this from a person who never writes reviews.
"October 25, 2020",Larry SD,5.0,,The sound is great and the battery life has been good. I like this type of bud because the others do not stay in my ears. I also like that I can use one bud at a time so I can listen to my favorite podcast and hear other sounds around me while wearing. I really like that the led meter tells me how charged they are too. They recharge quickly as well.
"April 17, 2021",Ainslee1777,5.0,11,"INCREDIBLE value. These little Bluetooth headphones are 100% worth the price!! Pretty good sound. Decent noise cancellation. Awesome battery life. They even stay on for intense workouts! (Jump roping, burpees, treadmill, rowing, weights, rolling out, etc.) Super impressive. Just follow the directions to pair. Bluetooth range from phone is about 15ft. Well done Occiam! BUY THESE."
"January 10, 2021",CdHM05,5.0,,No issues with ordering. No issues with shipping - my order came in on time. Registering for warranty was simple. Charging has been simple. Manual for my earbuds has been easy to read and easy to follow. Everything was in the box that was supposed to be in the box. I just received my earbuds today so I'll update if they are less than expected.
"March 20, 2021",LJN,5.0,,"These earbuds have a great sound quality, and they do a great job of canceling outside sounds without putting pressure on my ear canals. They pair up quickly, and I like that they register as one device on my phone, unlike some that I've had that register the right and left separately. I'd definitely buy again."
"January 27, 2021",Kindle Customer,2.0,,"I got these as a speedy replacement to some skull candies- I use my headphones A LOT mostly for calls with my partner across the pond. The sound quality is fine, bass is fine, but the mic leaves quite a bit to be desired. You really have to ensure that you're raising your voice for the mic to detect you and forget wearing these outside. The mic is more likely to pick up every sound around you and never your voice- which is silly, seeing as they're literally on your head and inches from your mouth. Pretty disappointed."
"February 28, 2021",amazon chris,5.0,,"This is a fantastic pair of earphones. Lightweight, works and a earhook that fits. For the price, the product is above it's price point. A very useful bonus, both a digital battery meter for the case and individual battery gauges for the headests, no need to guess. Battery life is more than sufficient for me. Can you compare it to the top Apple, Beats, Bose or Sony products? That's unrealistic. The sound quality isn't perfect, but for the price, it's easily 80% as good for 20% of the price. Unbeatable deal."
"April 2, 2021",Amanda West,5.0,,Battery life is great.  I have charged in the case twice so far and only charged the case once.  I use this to take calls while at work so my customers won't hear my personal calls if they call in and I listen to music during slow times.  Or when my husband gets on my nerves🤣 it fits perfectly in my ears
"December 30, 2020",Monique,5.0,,"I love them so far.  The case is so cute with the LCD light and for the price the sound is good and clear and they pair so well with my phone.  I truly love them better than the Beats3 I returned yesterday.  The sound quality is much better than the beats 3 headphones, the fit is secure for me and you cant beat the quality compared to the prize."
"March 20, 2021",kiks,2.0,,"bought to use as headset to talk on my phone while driving. it's no good, no one can hear or understand what I'm saying. waste of money. I have to turn up volume so much to hear what I'm listening to that when my phone does ring, the automated ""incoming call"" announcement is so loud it hurts my ears."
"January 19, 2021",Kevin Drews,5.0,,I really love these earphones. I was skeptical being that they are so reasonably priced but they're awesome! The battery life is way longer than expected and the sound is crisp and clear. They also fit comfortably and securely when I go on a run. I've thought about buying them again just to have a second pair to keep in our second home rather than carrying these around. Really a worth while purchase.
"April 18, 2021",DarrellD,5.0,,"I bought these at the recommendation of a coworker who really liked his pair. I use mine for running and unlike some earbuds, these stay on your ear due to the over the ear clip and don’t bounce off. The sound is better than I expected with decent bass for an earbud at this price point. I really like the case which recharges the earbuds fir me between runs. I typically run foe an hour and listen to music. Between runs I put the earbuds in the case where they recharge. I have not run the case completely out of charge but would estimate I could get five charges before the case itself would need to be charged. The case is black and compact. I put a decal on it to make it easier to find. I would definitely buy again."
"May 5, 2021",Justin & Courtney Shaw,5.0,,"I work in a Diesel shop and there is constantly loud noises and motors running so I was looking for some headphones that would cancel out some of the noise, produce good sound quality, and be comfortable throughout the day without breaking the bank. These headphones are by far the best I have found! They sit in my ears really well and I don’t have to worry about them falling out. The battery’s charge fast and then last most of the work day with constant use. When they die, the charging case is a quick and easy charging option when I’m not near a plug to plug it into. If your looking for great sound and a cheap price, these are for yo."
"December 23, 2020",Mz50,5.0,,"I have found my new favorite ear headphones! The battery life lasts FOREVER! I purchased these because my Bose sounded good but died in couple hours and the sound quality when talking to people sucked!!These Occiam  headphones are AMAZING and at a great price! Sound quality, battery life and microphone quality! Thank you!!"
"January 26, 2021",We r difrnt,5.0,,"There are multiple reasons why I would gift these to a friend or family member. 1. The digital analog of showing me the amount of charge I have left before the case needs to be charged again. 2. When I put them on they don't move or even feel like they are over my ears. 3. I can use one ear at a time, then when that one runs dies I can use the other on top of being able to use both at the same time."
"March 3, 2021",ann collard,4.0,,These are the best earbuds I have ever owned.  Especially during this crazy mask situation I lost 2 pair so opted for ones with the slip around ear.  The sound quality UNBELIEVABLE BUT THE BATTERY LIFE..Amazing!  The only problem I had is lid broke where there is a pin holding it together.  Good ole gorilla duct tape fixed that.  Case charges them without bring plugged in. Love them.
"January 1, 2021",dbonline,4.0,,"I found the headset to be comfortable and the sound quality good.  I do get 8 hrs of play time in my left earbud, but the right one only lasts 7hrs.  I have charged and drained the battery a dozen times, but only get 7 hrs max from the right earbud.  It is kind of annoying , but aside from the batter it is a good headset."
"January 14, 2021",Shirl,5.0,,"My son recommended these, and I am so pleased with them. I was looking for something that was light weight easy to wear and no background staticky sounds. I got that and more, great sound for both music and voice. I love the long time charge, and range in distance from my phone, I can move around at ease. Love them."
"April 22, 2021",A. Price,5.0,,"Wanted something comfortable with glasses, these are nice and light and don’t get in the way of my glasses. Took them on a run tonight. They don’t make my ears ache. Nice and light and stayed in place. I’m not an audiophile, so I can’t comment on the sound quality than to say it was fine for me. The charging case is a nice feature"
"July 2, 2021",Kindle Customer,2.0,One,"These skip pretty bad, lose connection while in the same room. Replaced with another brand and everything works fine. I guess battery life is okay, but basically can't use them."
"April 18, 2021",Bluto,1.0,One,2 months in and the right ear bud won't charge. Before this happened I was very happy with them. Unfortunately they are less than useful now.
"September 16, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,These are AMAZING. I feel like they should cost more. I can't believe how well they work. I love the charging case and the fact that you can use just one at a time. The quality and comfort blows me away. One accidentally went through the washer AND dryer and it STILL WORKS! I have been telling all my friends and family to buy this brand!!
"June 8, 2021",L.,5.0,,I love the case. I love the lighted battery info. I love the magnetic case. I love how fitted the earbuds feel. I love the battery Life. I use them for watching YouTube on my iPad..and phone for phone calls. They work great for that. I just wish they were louder for music.. with more BASS... But overall I really like these.
"May 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,"So I bought this product on March 26. Today is the 5th of May and the left earpiece suddenly loses the sound until it totally disappeared. Used the case to see if it was charged and it is one bar less. Tried to check the bluetooth from my phone and that left earpiece can still control the volume, but no sound is coming out from it. I haven't dropped it at all or in any way damaged it just by using the product for working out."
"April 8, 2021",S and A,5.0,,"Sound is very good with a snug fit. They do not come out of my ears even with sweat rolling down my face and ears. No problem getting wet with sweat, keep working and stay in place. This is my best ear buds ever, others were popping out when I cut grass or walked. I highly recommend these."
"May 31, 2021",Beyonder,2.0,,"I use lots of in-ear Bluetooth earbuds. They can occasionally fall out while I’m riding my bike, so I tried these thinking that they’d be a better choice. These things hurt my ear canal, something most in-ear buds never do. Too bad, as they are pretty good otherwise.."
"December 17, 2020",Brian,5.0,,"These are the most nonevasive ear buds I've ever used; very comfortable to the point you will forget they are even there. They also stay in place better than other sets I've tried that tend to require constant readjustment to achevive the best sound quality or eliminate the feeling that they just might fallout altogether if you don't. Sound quality is on par with or even better than my wired  headphones that I all but dread using any more than I have to since it seems that the harder I try to not have them become a tangled mess, the less successful I am in doing so.........These just might be the wireless buds you can buy at their price point."
"February 17, 2021",james Hopper,5.0,,"I was skeptical at 1st about the price. Thinking they would not be that good. I was wrong! The sound is ok, they are not Beats but not too far off in my opinion. I have the Beats like these with the wire attached (can't remember the name right now). I have stopped using my Beats once I received these. I love them, don't have to worry about the wire being caught on something and having the headphone pulled out my ear. The battery life is great. Have not had them run out of juice on me yet. I use them on the way to work and use only one when I'm at work and both on the way home.  I only charge the case maybe once a week or a week and a half.  I recommend picking these up."
"April 16, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"I loved them at first for the sound quality and great price. I had to give two stars now because I have had them for a couple months and I am having issues with them. They keep disconnecting even though fully charged. I press the side button to get the music to play, sometimes it works,sometimes it doesn't. Headphones shut off multiple times during my workout which is very frustrating. Then after a few minutes it will tell me it is on , then connected, just to disconnect again."
"April 29, 2021",Noah Gehrls,1.0,2,I hate these headphones. They constantly automatically reconnect no matter how many times i turn them off so the batteries are always drained when i actually need to use them. If i hadn't missed the return window by a day they'd be on their way back. Probably the worst amazon purchase I've made.
"February 2, 2021",jake,2.0,,"First pair I ordered, the left ear wouldn't connect to my phone. Had an easy return and replace experience. Second set, the right ear would intermittently disconnect or just go out. Had to lightly tap the device to get it to reconnect. Only used them for lifting in the garage, so no extreme activity. Sound quality was average, but only when they actually worked."
"June 7, 2021",Merry K.,4.0,,"These earbuds have great sound and stay charged forever.  But I have a bit of trouble getting them on and getting the bluetooth to connect—and the case has a flimsy hinge and comes apart all the time.  On balance, however, they’re great and I recommended them to a close friend."
"November 20, 2020",Rick M,5.0,,"I was using apple airpods yet they wouldn't fit very well in my ears, felt like they might fall off. So i wanted something with ear hooks. This one had a good review from a lot of people, decided to try.  So far, I am pretty satisfied: sound quality is excellent, battery seems to last long, and pairs with my iPhone real easy. Hard to beat the price!"
"February 6, 2021",Mary Alice Bean,5.0,,I purchased a pair of wireless earbuds but couldn't keep them in my ears. Finally found these and love them. Great sound. Can even leave my phone charging in the kitchen and still listen to an audible book while working in the garage or cleaning around the house (just as long as I don't run the vacuum).
"June 22, 2021",Laura Smith,1.0,,I've had these for just under 2 months. They weren't my favorite from the beginning because they hurt my ear and didn't fit quite right but I just thought I had to get used to them. I used them when my old pair died. Just went to use them and the left one doesn't work at all.
"January 18, 2021",Teresa R. Rapach,5.0,,"Earbuds are great! We have two parrots and they squawk at every little noise... especially the tv, music, and telephone. I can listen to my podcasts, music and watch tv and our parrots are quiet!  All the sound comes through the earbuds without disturbing them! Then when I’m done I can talk up a storm with them!! LOL!"
"January 16, 2021",Wendy,5.0,,I love how fast they arrived and I love how they fit on my ear. Super comfy. A lot of over the ear buds usually are not comfy but these are and I live that because I can not wear the ones that fit in the ear. Directions were easy to follow to pair with my phone too. I love that I can use one or both at a time.
"December 16, 2020",D. Zhou,5.0,,"I have tried many of these Bluetooth earbuds at the same price range, this is the only one I kept, I returned all the rest. So far, I loved it, I did not notice any flaws yet, the battery life is perfect, it will last me an entire day without recharging, and people never complains about my voice level for phone calls!"
"July 9, 2021",Artie T.,2.0,,I really like these earbuds. I would give them a 5 star review if it wasn't for the confusion of the listing and the run around from customer service. I purchased these for listening to music on my personal phone and being able to take business calls on my other phone. I simply wanted to know if I could listen to music on 1 phone and receive calls from the other. The simple truth is you can not do this. After going back and forth with customer service and not getting a straight answer I gave up and will only use these when I am off work and mowing the grass. What a waste of my time.
"June 26, 2021",Justin Mikkelsen,3.0,,"For the price you can't beat the quality. I really liked them. One significant issue made me give it 3 stars. I am an iphone user. When a call comes in while on another call, so call waiting, if I hang up on the first call, the headphones will simply not allow you to pick up the second call. It forces you to pick up the phone. Being on the road and using them while driving, this is a really big sticking point that has led me to replace them with another brand already."
"April 5, 2021",Richard Knuth,5.0,,"Got them 4 Apr 21.  Fast pairing, clear sound, more bass than expected. I am pleased and would recommend. Not the fanciest pair out there (Answer, end, reject call.  Play/Pause, previous song/next track, volume up/down, power on/off), no noise cancelling.  More than adequate for my daily needs."
"February 12, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"These are great headphones and the sound quality was amazing. I was looking for something that could help me multitask so that I could exercise, listen to my audiobooks and also join my random zoom calls throughout the day. You can only connect with one device at a time but that was not a dealbreaker for me. Plus they are relatively easy to pair with other devices. I tested to make sure people could hear me pretty well and they can. I would say the only downside is that the volume control, power off/on, and switching between songs is not very intuitive. It is better to use the device that the headphones are paired to for controlling the audio honestly. Overall great value!"
"December 19, 2020",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"*update: the company has reached out to me twice to rectify the situation which I appreciate so they get an extra star. However, something is wrong in their QC process if headphones like the ones I received are considered to “pass”. Charged these and was able to use them once before they refused to ever turn on again. While charging the left headphone the case made an annoying high pitch ringing. A waste of money unfortunately that have been returned as I didn’t want a paper weight."
"November 22, 2020",Janet,5.0,,"I'm loving my new headphones! I love that they last so long (really nice for long runs, cleaning, and super long audio books) AND that I can just throw them in the mini case to charge instead of plugging them in. I also love that I can use one at a time to really maximize how long I go without needing to charge. These headphone are exactly as advertised and perfect for my needs. I also love that they don't have cords hanging down from them to make it easy for my 7 month old to yank out of my ear!"
"June 20, 2021",Demi,1.0,,"The right ear bud works, but the left one goes in and out every single time I’ve used them. It says “power on” stays on for anout 10-30 seconds and then turns off. This is without touching anything or moving. I end up just using the right. Update: The buds won’t stay disconnected when charging in the case. So I have to keep my Bluetooth off on my phone when I’m not using them. Very frustrating. Keep in mind my husband has these same headphones and he hasn’t had issues with them so, I’m not sure why mine are garbage."
"June 14, 2021",Bre Robles,5.0,,"The company is honest and helpful. There is a lifetume warranty on these headphones. The charging pack looks very futuristic, showing the charging percentage. I only buy heafphones that wrap around the ear like this. Great for running or weightlifting."
"May 19, 2021",M. P.,5.0,,"These buds are really comfortable. They stay put without hurting my ears. Also, the display let's you verify that they are connected to the charging port. Sound quality is good. I'm listening to people not music so can't speak to the bass but the quality for me is clear."
"June 22, 2021",HuskerNomad,5.0,,"I just started training for a half marathon and needed a pair of bluetooth headphones to use for music during runs. I've used these on a 6 mile and another 3 mile run and so far so good! The sound quality is excellent, crisp and clear while also allowing you to hear some ambient sound which is important for safety reasons while out on a run. The headphones also always stay in place on my ears while running which is another big plus. Connecting these to my phone was super easy and after the initial setup, they connect automatically everytime I take them out of the charging case. Overall these are a great value and I will definitely consider this brand on future purchases."
"December 31, 2020",Chris Holstine,5.0,,"Just received.  Very easy sync to my phone. Test call was okay, we’ll see how they work this coming work week.  Not sure if the noise canceling will be desirable or not. For music they do sound great.  Solid bass. Update two days later:  One possible concern.  I fully charged the earbuds and after 48 hours they are now at 92% based on the charge level meter in the case.  So they lost 8% of the charge just sitting in the case (zero usage after the full charge).  I'm not sure what's causing the drain on the battery, maybe the case, or poor battery circuit design?  Time will tell, but it will be an inconvenience if they have to be fully charged right before use."
"January 28, 2021",kam,3.0,,"After a few Weeks the microphone stopped working consistently. Making it difficult to communicate with people on calls. Easy to pair with, and good sound quality. Haven't been able to test all of the metrics, but they feel very secure in your ears when doing activities. They do highly encourage that a 5 stars review is given in order to get a free product and limited lifetime warranty. This seems a little manipulative, and Id encourage all buyers to take these reviews with a grain of salt. FYI Many no name brands on Amazon actually do this."
"February 15, 2021",James,5.0,,"Purchased these Occiam Bluetooth Headphones for my wife who has never liked any other earbuds before them saying that they never fit well in her ear. These have a loop that fits over her ear and when she tried them on ""finally"" said she liked them. She hasn't paired them yet but if they're half as good as their reviews (which are outstanding) then she will be very happy to finally have some buds that she can use. She's on the phone as a real estate agent all day long so this will greatly aid her in her occupation."
"June 1, 2021",KJ in SD,5.0,,"I don't have a history with earbuds and bought these for my sons first.  So no comparison to make, just based this purchase off price and reviews.  But, that being said, so far so good.  My son uses them all the time and when I asked him about them he had no complaints."
"December 7, 2020",moira stanton,2.0,,"I like the sound quality but I can't use these on a daily basis.  I get a ""low battery"" warning after only a couple of hours use.  When I put them in the charging case, it shows them almost fully charged.  But they can't be used because it won't shut up.  Also I can fully charge the earbuds and the case and let them sit for a couple days (over the weekend) and they will lose much of the charge.  I can't use them.  I wish I hadn't picked them."
"December 29, 2020",K. Grubaugh,5.0,,"Pleasantly surprised after trying Apple airbud plus, Skull Candy earbuds, and two others but did not provide length of battery or pairing as easy or every time as advertised. Also like your battery case that shows digitally the charge. Paired every time. Also like the safety of over the ear security."
"June 17, 2021",Alea,2.0,,"When these headphones work they're 5/5. They charge pretty quick, the dock case holds alot of charge, I'm happy with how loud they get and the music quality,... but there not always 5/5. Occasionally when im walking down the street around buildings or under bridges, the sound cuts out for sometimes up to 10 seconds. The more months im using these, the more often they randomly cut off. Even when im sitting on my phone now, the left one had cut out, very weird. I know $40 isn't alot for wireless individual heaphones, but every amazon product advertises that these products are perfect, and they are far from it"
"May 21, 2021",JP,5.0,,"Very nice product at a very affordable price. Sound quality is excellent and the charging case is a nice feature. Battery life seems nice at this point. The whole product, down to the packaging, is surprisingly sleek for an ""off brand"" product. Very, very pleasantly surprised by what a nice product this is."
"February 22, 2021",Veteran,5.0,,"THERE GREAT , SO CLEAR , WISH  THE TIME WAS MORE, BUT SO CLEAR, I  USE IT IN MY EAR AT NIGHT  TO HELP ME CLEAR MY BRAIN AND TO HELP ME SLEEP,  I LOVE THEM WOULD BUY AGAIN , FIT IN MY EAR GREAT,  I HOPE THEY LAST, !!!! THERE MADE IN CHINA,  , SO THAT WORRIES  ME  , ONLY THING ABOUT  THEM !!!"
"March 5, 2021",Edgar G. Sandoval,5.0,,I lost my apple airpods and there was no way I was going to spend $200 on a replacement...  I decided to try these and boy I was impressed. Great quality and value for the price.  I use them daily to go to the gym mostly and they are great...  I am only curious what would happen if Iose the case...  Not sure there is another way to charge them...  They have good sound and volume range and they work without issues with my iphone and iwatch. But they are a smart by for the price!!
"November 15, 2020",curtis jones,5.0,,"I really like this airbuds.  I think the sound quality and functionality is great.  I can pause, rewind, activate assistant and control the volume of the Bluetooth. It’s perfect for my workout sessions. They don’t fall out, they are very comfortable and the battery last a long time. The battery display is nice and useful. I have them connected to my tv when I am working out."
"March 29, 2021",Christina,2.0,,Ok so I bought these headphones. They looked and sounded so good I was happy with those headphones for a few days but then the car didn’t not want to charge and once the car died on me I could not charge the headphones anymore which I was very disappointed about because they sounded very good
"March 4, 2021",JC,4.0,,"These earbuds work ok. For the price point, I'd say it's fair and would buy again. I've used them for working out. While jump roping they come out and have to be readjusted. When just walking around they're fine. I like the ear loops, very helpful in keeping them on.  No complaints for the battery life."
"June 30, 2021",Jill Stonesifer,5.0,,"These little things last forever. I haven't plugged them in for 2 weeks, mind you I don't use headphones 24/7. I use them at lunch for my walks, over the weekend for maybe 1-3 hours and here and there for calls. They are easy to set up, paired easily to my phone or tablet and are great at noise canceling. They charge pretty quickly too."
"May 7, 2021",Kristina,5.0,,"Great! I wear them at work and they have a great range on them. They are very clear, loud and also background noise blocking. I have very tiny ears and they fit great and don't hurt after hours of wearing. I love the charging station in the little box it came with. The charge lasts all day love and charges quickly. Great price and great quality! I will definitely buy again in the future!"
"May 13, 2021",carlu66,5.0,,"I really like this  product better than the previous earbuds that I had. I especially like the way it clips onto your ear with the soft silicone clip. The other ones I had would fall out with slight movement, These stay on no matter what I highly recommend them"
"April 28, 2021",Patricia Castillo,3.0,One,These are not what I was hoping for. But they’re meh. Pros: -they connect right away after taking them out of their charging case. -they are ok for talking on the phone. -the pause button works. Cons: -they sporadically cut out even when fully charged. -you have to turn both of them off individually. -they will turn on by themselves and reconnect whenever they want. -none of the other buttons work.
"July 16, 2021",k-mac,2.0,,"I bought these so my dogs wouldn’t go crazy every time my phone pings. I only use the right side and the volume wasn’t loud enough for most calls however my one dog could sill hear the ping from the earbuds. This is my first pair of wireless earbuds so have nothing to compare to. They’re comfortable enough. I rarely use the Bluetooth on my iPhone but when I connect to the earbud, it drains my phone battery VERY quickly. I’m returning and hope another product works better."
"March 26, 2021",Tammy Barringer,5.0,One,"I'm only writing this because the warranty forces you to do so or they won't activate it, they head phones are a 4 star, they work"
"March 4, 2021",Hal Freeman,5.0,,"I've only had these headphones for a couple of days, but very happy with them so far.  They charged quickly and paired with my phone with no problem.  Sound quality is quite good.  As a ""fit in the ear"" earbud hater, I was hesitant to order these but they are very comfortable.  I love the security of the over the ear flexible earpiece.  I have used both to listen to music while working out and used them individually as a bluetooth for phone conversations and they work flawlessly for both.  I can't comment on battery life yet since I have not worn them for an extended period of time yet but feel sure it will be adequate. Will be ordering another pair for my husband."
"April 17, 2021",Dan,3.0,,"The charging case for these earbuds has a USB-C port, but it doesn't follow the USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) standard.  If your charger uses cables with USB-C connectors on both ends (MacBook chargers, for example), this case probably won't work with it.  I tested two of these cases with multiple chargers, and both of them only charged over USB-A to USB-C connections."
"April 30, 2021",RS,2.0,One,"Great fit & sound quality. Used a few times per week while running.  But after less than 2 months, one of the earbuds stopped charging. I cleaned the receptors in the charger and on the back of the earbud, but no luck. So I have one working earbud now. Disappointing."
"November 13, 2020",J.M. Mass,5.0,,"I feel that this product is a great value for the price. I have purchased other brands at a much higher price and always told I sounded like I was in a tin can or underwater. People can actually hear me and not the background noise. Also love the charging case display showing percentage charged. I am also very happy with voice assistant working well with the Samsung 9plus phone, all I do is press the MFB button three times and say OK google and it works great! All in all very satisfied with this purchase."
"December 24, 2020",PS,5.0,,"Great earphones. I have been looking for a comfortable pair of ear phones , and tried a few, and finally found these. Can’t be happier. Some times, both my husband and I watch TV using these earphones at the same time, as just wearing one will do the job. I only wished that the volume is better controlled."
"May 25, 2021",mlm,5.0,,I love how easy they are to pair to my phone and the sound quality is amazing.  I have a Bluetooth that my employer provided for me but it is awful. When I got these I paired them with my work phone and they sound so much better!  Thank you for making a great product!
"March 8, 2021",Moshe,3.0,3,"I like these earbuds and I decided to keep them. I bought them in December and have been using them for 3+ months by now. First,  they sit well on my ears. The sound is good to very good. I am listening to talk radio most of the time and it is good enough for me. The volume is not very loud, which is also ok for me, and definitely protects my ears. The battery meter on the case is a great feature and I used it a lot. I can use each earbud independently - and that's how I use mine. Mostly the right ear one, sometimes the left ear. I like to be connected to my surroundings when I am using them. What issues have I found: * The number one problem I see, which doesn't affect me practically, is that when I use both of them together, there are disconnections. The sound moves from left to right and vs. - that's a problem.  But since 95% of the time I use only one earbud, this hasn't been an issue for me. But it will be for those that want to use both (most of you, I presume) . * It took me a while to figure out how to fix disconnections from my phone.  From time to time the phone indicates that it is connected, but no sounds comes out of the earbuds. The solution - turn them off, unpair and repair, and voila they work again. But, it is annoying. Maybe the issue is on my phone? I don't think so, since this is the only BT device that does that for me. * The case has 3 problems. 1 - hard to open, 2 - some times you confuse the back for the front. I think a better design should solve that.  and the 3 - it is very fragile. It fell for me and broke the hinges In summary - these are very nice value for their cost. But they are not perfect by any means. They work for me."
"January 6, 2021",starbud,5.0,,"I bought these for my son and he LOVES them!! He takes them everywhere with him. They are light weight and have a long battery life. Great product and sound qualities. I was a bit nervous to buy these, as the price point seemed too good to be true, but I am SO glad that I bought them. They are a great value for your money!! Buy with confidence!"
"March 2, 2021",Sheryl,5.0,,I love these earbuds. They last practically all day while I work and needs to be recharged only after about 6 hrs. the charger itself never runs below 75%. My ears are very small but these earbuds accommodate me in that they don't have to go around my entire ear and they wear well even with the face mask. Perfect!
"December 29, 2020",John D. Rogers Jr.,3.0,One,"I purchased these to replace my over the ear headphones. BIG mistake,they can't no comparison in sound quality at all. These are good for phone conversations only. The battery life is good. Other than that nothing else positive of this purchase for me"
"April 7, 2021",A. WEBB,5.0,,"I dont usually write reviews, but I had to with this product.  I LOVE them. The sound is nice and clear and noise can definitely be tuned completely out if they're turned up enough. I bought these because these are my first of this style. (I'd stlill been using the cordless ones with the wire connecting the buds.) I didn't want to spend too much money on a trial. Since they are my first, I have nothing to compare them to, but I'm happy and the price makes it all the better. P.S. The battery life is also great. I listened for a few hours and it only dropped about 5%."
"November 2, 2020",Rudy,3.0,2,"Love the sound, but the case is hit or miss if it charges."
"January 9, 2021",Deborah,3.0,One,"It’s a good buy, if you want something quick. After 1 1/2 months the left ear phone stopped working so if you plan on using it a long time, but another brand."
"January 29, 2021",Not so impressed customer,3.0,,"Sounds clear and easy to use. UPDATE*** I used these pair all day long for a few days. When I was listening to music or watching YouTube/Netflix, they worked great. It was so easy to connect to multiple devices as well. The only reason I ended up returning them was the poor sound quality on phone calls. I was able to hear everyone on calls or any video chat platforms. However, every single person on the other end said that my voice was muffled/echoed, and the volume was in and out so often that it was intolerable. I needed a pair for conference calls, so these pair failed miserably. If you don't use them for calls much, these were great especially for the price."
"November 13, 2020",MNR,5.0,,"They look good, fit really comfortably and they sound better than I expected. The charging case looks sleek. Didn’t realize how well the noise canceling worked until my wife was talking to me from 10 feet away and I had no idea because I couldn’t hear her, money well spent! I’ll probably buy some of these as gifts too, they are that good"
"January 3, 2021",Teanna,2.0,,"Headphones were great the first few days, but within a week the case wouldn't charge. I went through the motions of trying a different cord, outlet, and charging block. No luck. I returned product and asked for a replacement instead of money back and the second pair had a broken case within the week. Definitely could be good headphones, but 2 out of 2 faulty cases make me think they were a waste of my time and money."
"February 23, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,I know a great review makes people doubt that your a real person. I assure you that I'm real and I love these head phones. They stay charged for more than 8 hrs. Then with the case's  ability to charge the units I have yet to come to the end of the charge. The sound is clear even when you turn the volume down. As for noise canceling ability I don't like not being able to hear whats going on around me so I'm very satisfied. My only issue  is that my ear canals are small so wearing them for long periods can get a bit uncomfortable. I deal with that. I think I'll have to find smaller rubber thingys. Umm did I say that there is no guessing  whether or not all of your pieces are fully charged.
"July 6, 2021",Alice Loper,1.0,,"When I bought these, I was pleased to have finally found affordable, good quality wireless headphones. The sound experience was great until the headphones stopped connecting about 6 months in. At that point, only one headphone played music. I returned them for a new pair, thinking this must’ve been a fluke. But 5 and a half months later, they once again broke leaving me listening to music in only one ear. I don’t plan on getting another pair of these, and I recommend you don’t either if you want to your headphones to work for more than 6 months."
"February 23, 2021",Em Ily,5.0,,"So far so good. Nicely packaged and upon opening i was surprised by the sleek and simplistic quality of the case. A free gift along with a lifetime warranty is offered for a good review but honestly I tried the headset out and I'm very pleased.  They are very comfortable and will stay in place unlike some of my other earbuds.  The sound is okay, not the best but not bad either.  If they last in durability or the company stand true to their warranty then I'd definitely say they are well worth it."
"December 31, 2020",Janele Leatham,5.0,,These are just what I was looking for. AirPods don’t fit my ears well and I could never exercise in them. I didn’t want to spend hundreds of dollars for something I only use occasionally. These have really good sound quality and stay pretty secure in my ear. They come with different size tips and I like that the charging case shows the battery percentage. I also like that My husband and I can each wear one at the same time. Overall I’m quite happy with my purchase!
"June 10, 2021",Karrot,2.0,,"They sound, feel good, but they don't charge right. I place the left headphone in the case and it won't properly contact the pins. It will contact them for a second and then the connection is lost. I basically have to hold it in place or work for 5 minutes to get it just right and then try not to lose the connection when I set it down. Not only does this not allow it to charge but it also means it will power on again and reconnect to my phone."
"January 4, 2021",Caitlin Brennan,5.0,,"Selected these because I wanted a compact, low-profile earbud that would not fall out when running and could be used together or individually.  Sound quality has been excellent, and have had no complaints from the other side of my conversations about excessive wind or other ambient noises.  Love the protective charging case too."
"January 23, 2021",Jennifer,5.0,,"I have used these three times now.  Twice inside (once cleaning and the other doing yoga) and once on a woods walk in the snow where I only used one, so I could hear things around me.  I wouldn't say they cancel noise, but I think they do block some of it.  Sound for me is excellent (I am not high tech), phone calls sounded great and the person on the other end said they could hear me really well, even with a winter hat on.  I haven't had them long enough to fully test the battery life.  I didn't have a problem connecting them to my phone or computer.  I also really enjoyed never having to adjust it while doing yoga."
"January 5, 2021",Brent Speno,5.0,,"This is my first set of earbuds was kind of worried to buy them because I didn't know much about them, but after reading the Review's I said lets try them? well I made great decision!! they happened to be left in my coat jacket and went through the wash boy I was made, but I let them dry out and come to find out they work good as new??"
"July 8, 2021",Emily Marr,1.0,,These have been such a disappointment. The do not stay contact and cycle themselves on and off. They do not sit properly in the charger and charge inconsistently. And both over ear hooks have broken off as of yesterday! This was definitely a waste of money for an inferior product.
"February 2, 2021",PB,5.0,,I bought these for running. Have only used them a few times so can’t comment completely on battery life. Sound quality and fit are really food. Battery life appears to be good. Very happy for the quality with the price. Didn’t want to spend a fortune on beats so these are good for the price.
"March 2, 2021",Sean,5.0,,"I love that the case is also a charger, so as long as the whole thing is plugged in, you essentially get two charges for one...handy if you're away from a charger. Battery life is great, sound quality excellent...but my favorite thing is they DON'T MAKE MY EARS ITCHY AND SWEATY! Great product."
"May 26, 2021",Ray,5.0,,"For the low price, good god they really are a full, crisp, clean sounding wireless set of head phones. The bass and midrange dont compete with each other... they compliment each other. I expected an set that I could use for audio books, but i got them from Amazon yesterday ,and went through my 2 hour workout today, wearing them the whole time, running through a playlist. The ambient noise cancelling is very good as is the look of the ear pieces. I told my GF to listen to them, she did and asked how much I paid, and she shocked... they sound as good as my beats earbuds and my girl's i-pods."
"December 22, 2020",KHo,5.0,One,Very comfortable for long periods of time and does not interfere with my eye glasses.  The bass is amazing.  I have small ear canals and in-ear buds cause me jaw fatigue.  I changed the buds to the small version and I barely know they are there.
"January 12, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"These are comfortable and wireless.  Battery live seems huge.  Case has battery which is nice.  would have liked a smaller case or maybe not quite as cheap feeling, but the headphones are amazing.  True test of noise cancelation is air travel, but that's not happening so I can't say for sure about that.  I do find that I don't have to turn the volume up as loud on my phone to hear them.  They are clear and clean sounding, lite.  Very nice.  Would buy again."
"March 9, 2021",Daniel Hershberger,2.0,One,Worked great for awhile now can only hear out one side. Tried different troubleshooting techniques but none worked. Would have given a better review if not for that.
"March 24, 2021",K. Broom,5.0,,"I wasn't sure about these wireless ear phone's at first, but once I received them I can say I'm truly pleased. The sound is awesome, the battery life is good, I love the design and the price isnt bad either. The only issue I have is some people as when I talk on them i sound like I'm in a tunnel on their end..😂"
"April 2, 2021",Jed C Lechner,1.0,,"These headphones seem appealing and fit quite well. However, the first pair I received, one of the headphones did not charge. I still decided to give them a try. After that the next set a single earpiece died in only a few weeks. Do not buy these. PLEASE do not waste your money on these."
"March 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,One,"These headphones are comfortable and I love that they are wireless, but they lose connection frequently. I like to listen to podcasts while I walk and they drop sounds between the right and left ears and have a spotty connection. I’ve tried turning them on/off and repairing the Bluetooth. It is really annoying and I eventually just went back to using my regular headphones. I wouldn’t recommend these."
"May 27, 2021",glen wells,5.0,One,Sound quality is distorted noise cancellation is a negative still waiting for a response from the company
"July 5, 2021",RascallyRabbit,3.0,,"Maybe my ears just aren't made for this style. The over-the-ear hooks kept causing the buds to pull away from my ear. I didn't have a chance to experience the battery life or the noise cancellation since they wouldn't fit very well. They do feel plasticky too. If I held them solid in my ear, I could tell the sound was balance and the bass was nice."
"June 11, 2021",Tim,2.0,,"The base charger stopped taking a charge after a few weeks. The headphones were perfect for the gym but I no longer can charge them. The base just displays a blinking ""05"" then doesn't ever go up. I've tried leaving it on a charger for hours without any luck."
"July 15, 2021",Saglady,1.0,,"The ear buds were not well balanced. Used for walking, the weight would allow the pieces to fall forward and fall out of the ears. The section behind the ear, made of soft rubber, was not adjustable therefore I was unable to make an adjustment to hold them in pl@ce. Not for me!"
"November 15, 2020",KP,5.0,,"I have been using these sport earbuds for 3 weeks and really like them so far. I rarely have an issue with connection. It is pretty stable. Another pro is a long battery life, other brands usually have 3 hrs or less but this one lasts longer than that. I used it for more than 4 hrs straight. It was still ok, no warning yet. Only disadvantage is the noise cancellation. I don’t think that this product has the noise cancellation feature. Other than that, I think it is worth every penny."
"December 7, 2020",Kindle Customer,3.0,One,"The couple of times they hooked up with my phone I was excited. The quality was great, but they kept disconnecting and then negatively affected my phone. Had to return them."
"March 1, 2021",Mark Del Rosario,5.0,,"The headphones sound great and stay on my ears. Connectivity is easy and fast. The only issue I have, which isnt really an issue, it the charging connection to the charging case, sometimes you have to make sure the earbuds connect directly to the case by pushing down on it."
"February 25, 2021",Brady Bud Eddards,5.0,,"Brought my mom a pair and figured id try them myself so I had a pair for work, the hook helps it stay in on my ears better but not so much in them. Sound is great with good bass, one other little compliment... I don't like how they go in the case to charge, the right earbud goes on the left side and the left sits on the right."
"October 3, 2020",Dixie Lee,5.0,,"Wow!  Earbuds have sure improved.  Love the clarity and noise reduction.  I can space off into my own little world without outside distractions.  Charge lasts for days, I'm sure lov'in them!  Soooo easy to connect . . . the first time.  Buttons on the Buds are easy and logical, none of that down is up business."
"January 9, 2021",Don J.,5.0,,"Took the headphones out of the box, put them in my ears, paired them to m phone, turned on Pandora and they started working immediately. The sound was excellent and the fit was very comfortable. A very pleasant surprise. I haven’t been able to use them on a phone call yet or check the battery time span but if it’s anything like the sound and fit plus the ease of setup they’ll be more than worth the cost of them."
"March 10, 2021",Robin Louise,5.0,,"These are AMAZING!  The bass was unexpected since they are cheap.  I had to give them to my son because I cannot have total noise cancellation at work, and I cannot stand wearing only one bud.  They are comfortable and easy to use.  Excellent product for a small price!!!"
"February 23, 2021",Marcus Whitford,5.0,,"The sound quality is amazing. I use it to listen to music and videos on my phone.  I have watched shows from Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. I also listen to it when I listen to XM Radio or listen to Pandora. The sound quality is amazing and they are comfortable when I wear for long periods of time. I  use it when I work remote for Zoom calls. The sound the other side hears from my side is very clear and understandable."
"May 6, 2021",jabez71,2.0,,Used for the first time today. Not very loud at all (and there is nothing wrong with my hearing).  The volume is especially bad for phone calls and that is what I bought it for. I would NOT recommend this product. I have a cheap $20 set that work better than these.
"April 1, 2021",Kista,5.0,,They stay where they need to be without any pressure points. I forget I have them on sometimes. Plus i can share the audio with my bf by simply handing him one of the pieces. You can sleep on your side with these too! Great for side sleepers.
"May 3, 2021",Denerio,5.0,,"I love these earbuds!!! I tried earbuds without the hook for working out and calls but I had to constantly push them back in my ears, but thats not and issue with these. The price is great and the sound quality, both music and calls is top tier! 10 out of 10 definitely recommend!"
"April 15, 2021",Tech. Now,5.0,,I like that they stay on my ears by going around the ear lobes. Really easy to set up on my phone. Sound is good. The only thing is that it goes in and out at times. It could be the phone that I have and the areas that I travel that interfere with reception.
"May 29, 2021",Helen A.,5.0,,I really love these earphones.  The sound quality is amazing.  The comfort is superb.  The charging is quick and the battery life seems to be forever.  I hardly need to recharge these. The price was perfect so I bought another set for my husband!  So worth the investment.
"February 26, 2021",Chakkababy,2.0,,"They fit good, and the weight is good, but the sound is like a pair from the 99 cent store. I don't know where these other reviews are coming from, but the sound quality is terrible. It's tiny and thin. The bass? What bass, I didn't hear any at all. I'm sending them back."
"December 29, 2020",Allyssa Davis,5.0,,"I got this product to use for calls in the car, cleaning at the house, and stocking at work after hours. They're perfect. They're small, the power reserve/charging case is perfect. My music sounds great! My test for noise canceling is a snap and a clap. I can hear both without music of course, if my music is at mid volume I can faintly hear a clap but not a snap. Honestly these are perfect and exactly what I was looking for. When they arrived I had a problem with the left bud not connecting, didn't even seem to be charging. Came back to the product and found a video to fix it that took no time at all."
"June 17, 2021",Gabriel,5.0,,"The fit well and comfortably.  They sound good with good bass coming through. Unfortunately, the right earbud stopped charging/working after a month (I use the earbuds couple times a week); right earbud wouldn't charge and has just stopped working.  But the seller was quick to respond to my email and reminded me that product is covered by warranty. They are in process of mailing me a replacement already!  Great customer service for comfortable earbuds that sound great!  Thank you Sammi from Occiam Customer Service for taking care of the issue so quickly!"
"April 1, 2021",bsg85,2.0,,"You can’t use more than one Bluetooth system without recharging which sucks if you’re doing Peloton then want to lift weights with your own music bc you need to get your case, do those whole reset that’s written in the FAQs then use them again. That part sucks."
"February 26, 2021",MidoriAlexandros,4.0,,"The volume controls do not always work, on either the left or right side. REALLY annoyed these do not have a mute function. Returning them. The sound is okay, I don't know that I would call it ""deep bass"", but it's the quality you would expect from a 25 set of headphones."
"October 23, 2020",Grace V.,5.0,,These earbuds are great for on-the-go! I have been using them for running and they stay on well. The battery life is nice and long and they are super easy to charge. The charging case is great to protect and recharge the earbuds during longer outings. I am very pleased with these earbuds and highly recommend them!
"March 16, 2021",Michelle B. Richards,5.0,,"I mostly use them with Audio Books. They are crisp and clear. They're decent for music. I washed one in the washing machine. After sitting for 24 hours, it accepted a charge and works just like before. For the price tag, you couldn't reasonably ask for better."
"June 12, 2021",KevMuzMan,4.0,,"So far, I like these earbud very much! I'll l have to see how the battery life hold up. They are very comfortable, fit well  and don't fall out. I've only used them for Zoom Video conferences thus far but, plan to try out the music sound quality."
"January 12, 2021",Deborah D.,5.0,,I ordered these headphones because of the over the ear design.  I have owned several pairs of Bluetooth earbuds in the past but always felt they were not secure in my ears on my outside runs.  When I received these and tried them out - they did not disappoint !! They are so comfortable and feel very secure and the sound is Amazing !! I wound up ordering a second pair as my son asked me to order him a pair when he heard the sound quality.  I am very happy with these headphones and also love the battery level display on the charging case.  Awesome headphones !!
"March 1, 2021",Riley Garcia,2.0,,"Mine took forever to connect, would sometimes disconnect. I couldn't perceive any noise cancelling ability. Sound quality was pretty good. Would definitely have invested more in a product without any connectivity issues. It's frustrating and THEN a representative from the vendor contacted me and offered to pay me $30 to remove the original review. Technically, isn't  that like maybe bribery....hmmm."
"January 4, 2021",Kdavis,5.0,,"My husband LOVES them!!  My husband is a sweater, sweats like a waterfall from his head, he goes to the gym 5x/week and has used them everyday since Christmas (when he got them).  He has not had to charge them yet!  Connection is excellent.  Sweatproof is holding up great!  He can't hear me when I'm trying to get his attention from a treadmill 6 feet away from him, so I have to wave like a crazy person.  His only con would be the sound quality, as he did give it a 4-star.  He said you can't hear the low, base sound very well, but its a crisp clear sound.  Overall still worth getting.  These are exactly what he needed to be ""free"" at the gym.  We are very pleased!"
"July 7, 2021",Jaycies,5.0,,"I needed a second pair of earbuds for the transcription I do so one is always charging.  Very quickly, I determined that this pair is definitely my favorite!  Comfortable, clear, and easy to connect to Bluetooth.  I'm very pleased with my purchase."
"March 11, 2021",Neal Hornaday,5.0,,My first review was great based on short time use.  However.  Given a weeks time now I’ve had constant issues with the connection dropping.  It’s very frustrating when your 20 ft from your phone on a conference call and it drops.  Overall not a recommended product.
"December 15, 2020",Boo7,4.0,,I brought these and really was impressed it sounds good lot of bass. I would have giving it a 5 star for it being really good headphones but the ear bud piece would not stay in my ear. I would lose sounds. So I brought some memory foams ear buds for it and what a big difference!!! Now it sounds great. So for those that are interest in buying these you may want to buy the memory foam ear piece for it.  Together it sounds great. I’m happy with my purchase.
"July 15, 2021",Darlyn&Ozzy,4.0,,"I tried many low cost ear buds and earphones.  These are secure around the ear,  fit nicely.  The sound is ok. I like heavy bass but this is medium.  Great for audio books,podcasts and o k for music.  But this is expected from an inexpensive set."
"June 16, 2021",JT,3.0,,"Super comfortable ear buds with great sound quality! Edit: these are still the most comfortable earbuds I’ve ever worn. They have great sound quality…when they work. My husband has a pair and they work great, but the sound cuts out for a couple seconds at a time, and this happens a couple times a minute, so it gets very frustrating. Not sure if I just have a defective pair."
"December 24, 2020",DM,3.0,,"I finally have earphones that actually stay in my ears so I am so happy, thank you! Edit: I was happy originally but after just a few times of using these earphones, the connection is constantly going in and out on both earphones. It is very frustrating and I am considering returning these."
"November 28, 2020",KJ,5.0,,"So far I am very happy with this product. It paired very easily with my iPad. I addition, the support team for this product seems very responsive when it came to registering the warranty. The sound is pretty good for the price of these earbuds, and they stay secure, which is the reason I bought them."
"June 1, 2021",c bean,5.0,,"I love these ear buds. They fit snug and the pause, play, and volume buttons are convenient. I had an issue with one of the ear buds outside of Amazon's return window. I reached out to Occaim customer support, and they sent me a new set of ear buds."
"May 6, 2021",FARAHDREAMS,5.0,,These are the best earbuds I've ever had. Connection with my phone was super easy. They easily stay in my ears and the bass and quality are incredible. I can't say much for staying power because I haven't used them enough but I love them so far.
"June 15, 2021",Tynesha M.,2.0,,I haven't even had them 3 months and they no longer work. They are supposed to be good in water when working out I sweat a lot and they didn't last. If you sweat heavy these are not the headphones for you. When working they are not bad for sound
"May 31, 2021",smattina,5.0,,I love these earbuds! The sound quality is awesome for the price. The digital battery life indicator is a bonus. I wear these earbuds during my long distance roller skate sessions & they are perfect. They don’t fall out of my ears. Well worth the purchase & highly recommend.
"November 3, 2020",Shane B.,5.0,,"I like these a lot. The fit is good and the sound quality is very good. The price is great for what you get. The battery life is adequate, I'd prefer for them to last longer, but for the price, it's not a deal-breaker. The pros are the sound quality and fit. A con is I'd like them to last longer."
"March 7, 2021",W. Carpenter,2.0,,"I am returning due to volume control issues. I tried to use this with the Tao Electronics Bluetooth transmitter, therefore no volume control ability at the source. Without a working volume controller on the ear end, it is blaring and I cannot do anything about it"
"May 10, 2021",MSW,5.0,,Bought these earphones for walking and bike riding. I’ve only had them a few days but I love them.  they are very comfortable and the fit is secure. Long lasting battery on earphones.  Great that you can see the charge percent on the inside of the case and both earphones. I would definitely recommend these earbuds
"July 16, 2021",AURORA,3.0,,"Music is great and all, But I got it so i could talk on the phone to family and friends while I was doing something. I get complaints saying that they could barely hear me, I sound muffled. I wouldn't get again just because I wanted a better microphone."
"January 10, 2021",andrea,5.0,,Love these earbuds! They are comfortable and have excellent sound quality. I like that it has buttons to change volume and songs vs a touch sensor. It was super easy to pair out of the box. I love that the charging case shows charge for ear earbud but the case does drain a bit when not in use.
"May 15, 2021",Thomas M. Vann,5.0,,"The sound quality is outstanding! My expectations were decent based on reviews, yet the headphones are far better than my original expectations. the case is very strong and holds charge for a very long time (it has yet to significantly deplete). The ear comfort is also exemplary."
"June 30, 2021",Caramelsun,5.0,,I have small ears and the wireless  headphones that go over the ear are the only ones that seem to fit securely on my ears but I didn't  want  to  compromise on  quality. These are exactly as advertised & a good price. I recommend this  product.
"December 3, 2020",Shikha Dogra,2.0,,"Update after a week’s usage: one of the earbud (right one) stopped working. Not sure what I can do about it. I guess there is no guarantee for this product. It’s a hit or miss. If the product works it’s value for money. For me it hasn’t worked. These are great pair of earphones in this price range. Probably one of the best ones. Very good battery life, connect easily without any issues or delays. I’ve had issues with earphones staying out in my ear and these are helping me overcome the issue."
"May 26, 2021",Matt Wilson,3.0,,These honestly might be the best fitting earbuds I’ve gotten to include those expensive ones. The issue that I’m having already is that they are cutting out while working out randomly here and there. Usually only last for a second but if I had the box still I’d return. Sometimes it’s just one ear sometimes both. No beep or voice just will cut out and come back on.
"October 31, 2020",Betty Sunshine,3.0,3,Quit working after 2 months
"April 14, 2021",Roxy Rouge,5.0,,"Great sound quality, paired within 2 seconds. Came charged and were very easy to use. Could easily listen to audio books at the gym and hear it clearly over the equipment. Music, obviously, sounds great too and has decent depth and tone through the earbuds"
"January 17, 2021",msaonika,5.0,,"My first pair didn't work very well. The volume function didn't work and the connection was iffy. I ordered a replacement pair and it was sent out to me fast. I have had a hard time finding a comfortable pair of earbuds, but these do the trick at a reasonable price. Thanks."
"May 29, 2021",Patrick,4.0,,"The battery display is a must-have! The sound is a bit quiet, if you like your audio loud, then look elsewhere. The charge lasts long, I just wish there were some sort of battery indicator externally to the box they're stored in."
"April 25, 2021",maryjane delacruz,5.0,,This is my 4th pair of different brands. These are well worth the money you can acthere the bass and they are loud enough to cover background noises. These work great when your jogging or gym time. They don't fall or hurt your ears. They are quite comfortable.
"February 13, 2021",Danno,5.0,,"Best I’ve had.  They last all day watching streaming movies and recharge over night while in their case.  Case will charge the the headphones several times and charges them quickly if needed.  A little pricy, but they’re worth a few extra dollars.  Highly recommend."
"July 15, 2021",Bryan,1.0,One,"i will just continue using my wired earbuds, the sound on these are awful in comparison. i have to crank the volume up to 100% just to hear anything but shrilling treble, and even then it's about half of the volume i get out of my wired earbuds. nothing personal, just not for me."
"December 2, 2020",Brandon Mann,5.0,,"I was wanting a pair of earphones that would fit well into my ear. I love the behind the ear bands to help hold the ear buds into place. In addition the ear buds sort of rotate into place and so they seat well into the ear canal, providing optimal sound quality.  In using the microphone feature I was told that I sounded good but was a little softer on their end.  Overall very satisfied thus far with my purchase."
"December 30, 2020",Sc,5.0,,"So far, I've been enjoying the headphones. They're not too tight around my ears, the audio comes in rather clearly, and it's a lot easier to make sure it's charging compared to my last set of bluetooth headphones. The only issue I've ever had is if both headphones aren't synced at the same time then it can lead to a few audio issues but this is easily remedied for me by just resetting the headphones in their case or turning them on/off again to make sure they sync up properly with my phone. Otherwise they've worked wonderfully for my needs thus far."
"December 17, 2020",Thomas Alley,4.0,,"This is a good set of ear buds. The reason I don’t give it a full 5 stars is because the volume buttons do not work properly. It’s as if the button cover does not like up properly with the transfer button to the board of the ear piece. Also when I receive a call it just says, “in coming call”. It does not say the persons name like my iPhone normally does. Great sounds. Great case. User friendly. Good battery life."
"June 22, 2021",Brundha Rajam Vijayakumar,5.0,,The earphone sits well over the ears. It takes a little practice to push deep into ear to have all the bass sound especially when you are first time user of the over the ear earphones. Battery backup is awesome. Case is little big but charges at a rapid speed. The sweat has not impacted the earphones till now. I also use it one earphone for calls. very rarely. Call quality is good in Quiet environment. Overall It is very good and helps me hear songs and podcasts in Bluetooth.
"November 28, 2020",Dante Adams,5.0,,"First off, the sound quality for me only seems like it’s designed for music.  There’s a lot of bass to the earbuds, almost enough to barely here the artist singing or rapping.  They do have tiny volume adjusters on the top, which for me they need to be a bit bigger for larger hands.  I love how I try so hard to shake them out of my ear they won’t even fall out, always a plus for these kind of earbuds.  I believe you can have one turned on while the other one is charging and the distance from which you can use one from the other is better than most.  Like I said in the beginning though, I tested out how they are on calling and it’s very muffled even on max volume but good thing I can’t here anything."
"April 24, 2021",Michael Piechowski,2.0,,"Sound quality is appropriate for the price, little to no bass and metallic mids and highs. The buds stay in your ears while working out and only require small adjustments as you sweat. The biggest downside of this product is the charging case. The case charges the buds, but continues to drain battery once the buds reach 100% if you store them in the case. So you will need to store the buds outside the case so the case doesn’t get depleted or plug the case in each time you wish to charge the buds. This case also does not work with some power bricks"
"June 18, 2021",outdoorzgirl04,5.0,,"Overall I like these earbuds, nice sounding and easy to work. I also like how comfortable they fit around my ears. Another side note is that I can pop the bud out of my ears and still talk and/or listen to my music while I talk to someone face to face"
"November 27, 2020",Avianlos,5.0,,"You really can't go wrong buying these because of the affordable price. I got them for my mom who is not the most tech-savvy person, so the individual volume control and pause buttons on each earbud were easy for her to use. She also likes the clear displays that let her know when she needs to recharge. The sound is great for the price and they stay on so she can use these while she cleans the house. Overall happy with the purchase so far."
"January 26, 2021",ScarlettJFG,5.0,,"Usually hate earbuds as they fall out of my ears very easily, thanks to the hooks these don't. On top of that the sound quality of these earbuds are...actually pretty damn good. I would play games with these if I didnt have a headset already. On top of all of that though these take FOREVER to die. I occasionally let my rechargeable devices fully die so that they can keep a full charge and these lasted quite some time. I had to keep them on overnight! Sound cancelation is there and it isn't ""there but crappy"" but is just below top notch. Maybe second rung? All in all these are really good for the price."
"December 17, 2020",Sandy,5.0,,"This is a great bang for the buck, good bass and decent range.  The power meter is a nice touch as is the option to use either ear bud independently.  If you get too far out of range it will start cutting out but if you're within 20-30 feet direct line of sight it stays paired."
"February 2, 2021",MIke Stalls,5.0,,I love these headphones. The buds don't fit in my ears comfortably so I have to get the kind that wrap around my ear. These are perfect. You can control everything with just one headphone. The sound quality and noise cancellation is top notch. Customer service is also top notch!!S
"March 24, 2021",Chris,5.0,,"Few weeks ago I got the hooked earbuds as a birthday gift from a relative, but just recently a about it is that failed to emit sound on one of the earbuds.  But before the problem came, I told my parents about it and I order them online for them and they love them.  The battery life is amazing! I was able to do my school work and work all day without worrying about the battery! I’m still upset the headphones I got from my relative that one of earbuds stopped working,  but at  least my parents are happy with there’s and the other ear buds still emits amazing sounds!  Nice brand, hope you guys continue to make new products in the future."
"March 3, 2021",Mrs.Smiley,5.0,,I wish I had bought these sooner! I had a pair with wires and would occasionally unintentionally pull one out as a I was running because my hands would get caught on the wire. These are absolutely amazing. Love running and cycling with them. I put in several hours of workouts and the battery life was only down to 60%. Get these!
"January 26, 2021",Ben Zander,2.0,,"I returned this item nearly instantly, as I could not get them to agree to do the things I wanted them to do, like turn on.  I wanted some earbuds to work out with and could be used for talking while driving, but was not able to operate them and returned them next day."
"December 21, 2020",Anthony P. Colon,4.0,,"The sound quality is good for both phone calls and for music, especially for the price point (1st star). Its comfortable (2nd star) and the ability to hook over the ear makes it great for going to the gym or bike riding (3rd star).  I also love the charging case and battery life which works wonders for someone like me who is constantly out of the house (4th star).  Where it loses its 5th star is the connectivity.  I could literally have my phone in my hand, not even 2 feet away from the T17's and I will lose sound in one of the ear pieces for longer than 15-20 seconds.  This happens when my phone is in my pocket or on my bikes phone holder.  This connectivity issue drives me crazy!"
"December 5, 2020",Adrianne,5.0,,"I purchased a set of these Occiam earbuds about 10 days ago. They are pretty amazing! Good bass line, no crackles, connects easily and automatically, both to one another and to control devices. I'm definitely thrilled with their shape; I cannot wear standard earbuds due to my inner ear shape, so the ones that hug the shell of your ear are so much more reliable. I was also concerned that I would run into the price ledge that standard earbuds fall into, where you have to fork over some serious cash. These were affordable and definitely worth their price. I'm in love with them. :)"
"February 20, 2021",Amanda,5.0,,I got these today and I love them so far.  I'm not sure about battery life yet as I haven't used them a lot to tell.  The sound is great! They also appear to work separately from one another.  The fit is good and it doesn't seem to bother my ear at all.  I would recommend for sure!!
"March 22, 2021",Sam gindin,3.0,,"Not worth it, sound is not good 0 bass and quiet. Keeps on disconnecting from the phone at least 10 times in a one hour workout. The price is ok, Im going to keep them in my car as a spare. My advice, get the letscom headphones, Great sound and good bass also unbreakable! Washed them twice in a washer-machine and they still work!"
"May 20, 2021",Temekia Hawkins,1.0,One,At first these were great then the right side started going in and out then it completely stopped working as if it had a shortage but how? I've only had for a few months so I can only use the left side and sometimes it acts as if It want to go out. I thought I could exchange but read the policy and it's too late. I don't recommend. Sorry
"June 25, 2021",Shannon Dee,2.0,,I really liked these but they stopped working after only 2 months. Sound quality is great but now they disconnect and reconnect periodically and the mic stopped working completely in the right the left has a serious echo problem. Too bad
"February 17, 2021",Halo Williams,5.0,,I LOVE these earbuds. The battery lasts a while prior to needing to be recharged. I think the best part is the battery life indicator on the case... it's a GREAT help. These connect quickly and easily without any issues. Love these so much!
"November 12, 2020",K. Robinson,1.0,10,"Over the years, I've spent a small fortune on headphones.  From the most expensive to disposable.  I've never owned earbuds because I am notorious for losing things.  This has been the best purchase I've made this year.  I love the hooks that keep the buds and love the different cushions. The sound quality is good.  Sound is not of particular interest. What is most important is the ability to connect to my phone easily. These earbuds connect seamlessly. It comes with an electronic charger case  for storage and easy charging.  I love it! UPDATE: Month 2 and the left bud is extremely low in volume, almost useless. The battery indicator in the case stopped working. You can't tell if it is charged or charging. I just leave it charging overnight and get less than 2 hours of talk time. Very disappointing."
"January 31, 2021",George Blasing,1.0,,"Very disappointed. They worked great but then one of them stopped charging after only 5 months. I've decided to order another pair, since they worked great at first. Perhaps I was just unlucky with the one not working any longer. Hopefully I'm not wasting more money giving these guys a second chance."
"April 22, 2021",ChaosRocker,5.0,,"These earbuds are pretty wonderful, while I have not used them for calls. I have used them while working, doing dishes, jogging, and other daily things, and I have yet to be disappointed in how they sound or feel. As a rock/metal listener, these really do have a nice base but on the flipside they were also able to pass a full frequency sweep and are very effective at blocking noise. Lastly, I have yet to have issues with battery life for regular use and the charge case is quock to charge not only itself but the earbuds."
"May 28, 2021",Chris Flores,3.0,,"Like the headline states, they are not very loud. If it's really loud around you, you won't be able to hear at all. Also, phone calls are just so bad with these. I've had people say they couldn't hear me at all. Other headphones usually it's just that I'm heard quietly but with these, I have to switch back to my phone."
"May 22, 2021",Cornelius,5.0,,"This is awesome when you have it hooked up to your Bluetooth whenever you pull it out of the box it's ready to go at anytime when you use it, you don't have to wait for it to link to your phone or any other device I give it five stars."
"April 29, 2021",Cynthia R.,1.0,2,Broke after 3 months. Won’t charge. One stopped charging after 1.5 months and now both won’t charge. Save your money.
"April 15, 2021",GOgunwal,5.0,,"Giving this product five stars, not just because it is easy to use and super comfortable as described,  but also for the excellent customer support from the team. I had procured 2 pairs of this product and after a week, the right ear piece on one of them  developed a problem. I reached out to the customer support and they were super responsive. They contacted me back immediately and guided me though some troubleshooting steps. They eventually sent me a replacement after the troubleshooting did not fix and solve the problem. I am really impressed with the communication and status update from the support team."
"February 23, 2021",DrBob,5.0,,Arrived in 1day. They were charged and ready to go. I am a woodturner and ware a full face shield when I work. The ear buds sound very good and I can talk on my phone with excellent quality. Wnen I do a YouTube live they work well. After one month they stopped working completely Wouldn't charge with any charger. Sorry I bought them.
"December 31, 2020",Mamagraybear,4.0,,"Wonderful fit, quality and noise cancellation.  Unfortunately for me, the charging contacts are on the inside of the headphones and come into contact with your skin...since I have an allergy to nickel, the contacts made me develop a painful rash.  Will be giving these to my husband to use and had to order a different design."
"March 6, 2021",nikki,5.0,,"I finally found a pair of headphones that I love! I have small ears and could never find headphones that fit right - either too loose and would fall out or awkward fitting and they make my ear sore. I’ve tried different styles and brands ranging from $15-$130. These are the best for me, perfect for workout out."
"February 8, 2021",CJ,4.0,,"Gotta admit I was impressed by these, they sound real good and the battery last. Also charges really fast. Only downside I found is it can sometimes give you trouble trying to connect to certain decives, and the noise cancellation isn't the best. But they are loud enough it's not that big of a deal."
"June 7, 2021",David T.,4.0,,"I really like listening to music with these, and the fit is great and secure. The microphone doesn't seem to pick up my voice well, though, so I can't use them for a phone call. But I boght them for the sound and fit, and the price was goodso I'm happy."
"January 14, 2021",Honey Girl,5.0,,"Great headphones for the price. They sound good. I haven't run with them yet though, I'll update after. Update: I have run with them a few times now and they will power off and on sometimes. I've found that after restarting the headphone that is doing this it is fixed."
"November 25, 2020",Georgia McNabb,4.0,,"I Bought these wireless headphones for my husband and he thinks with Sound quality on music,  the Stereo effect is Wounderful.  Listening to book good but could be better sound.  Noise cancelling Very good.  Only had these a short time so can not say much at this time about the battery life."
"June 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"Loved these while they worked. Not sure if I got a dud, but about 2 months after I got them, the left earbud just started cutting out for long periods of time. I tried turning it off and back on and unpairing and repairing it, but now I'm down to using just the right one."
"November 13, 2020",Rich Stawowy,5.0,,"Needed to make sure I found a pair of earbuds that wouldn't fall out of my ear, and honestly, I wasn't in the mood to drop  $75+ on it. And I think we hit a jackpot with this right here. Sound quality, I think is better then apple airpods, if not, at least on par with them. Especially for the price point,."
"July 12, 2021",PetitPoucet,5.0,,"I had to give them five stars for the amazing after sale service I got. I was pretty happy with these earbuds, but lost one. I contacted the manufacturer, they answered quickly and immediately sent me a replacement. I received it in two days! Truly great service."
"January 4, 2021",Virginia Stoeckle,5.0,,"These were a present to my brother. He messaged me too say these are ""awesome!"". The sound quality is loud and clear, they stay in his ears while he is working (he has a physical job where he moves around a lot), and the battery life was still at 50% after an 8hr shift."
"March 9, 2021",Leroy,5.0,,"I charged them overnight and used them throughout the next day.  Took them out on a 4.5 mile run and both died.  I've been using for a week letting them discharge and recharge and they have been amazing.  I use them regularly, although if not listening to music, I only use one at a time.  Battery life gets much better after a few days, so give them a week at least before writing a review.  The range is great, use them all over the home while phone is charging.  Best tip is to use one at a time.  Definitely recommend this product."
"June 23, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"We ordered these headphones for our youngest son (11) who has small ears. We wanted wireless earbuds to eliminate the cords, but also something to keep them in his ears.  These seemed perfect.  When they arrived in February, they were easily set-up and connected to his tablet.  Now 3 / 4 months in, they will not stay paired to each other, so he can hear the music / video / movie in one ear.  They are also no dropping the sound on occasion. Time to find something better."
"January 25, 2021",Laura,4.0,,"I have purchased literally about a dozen wireless ear buds and it seems that, unless you're willing to drop a huge sum of money, they will never be loud enough for use in business.  And, the ears buds themselves get uncomfortable after about 15-minutes of use."
"March 2, 2021",Ellie,5.0,,"I purchased these for my wife and was glad for the hook on them, since they will be harder to lose or fall out. They do pair with all her devices, but it can be more of a manual process to get them from one to another. Sound quality and fit is good."
"October 24, 2020",Ron,5.0,One,I've only had these a few days now but  I'm impressed with the sound quality. Knowing that I can recharge with the case power supply 1 earbud at a time when necessary is another great plus.  They have been easy and comfortable to wear and are the first earbuds I've purchased that i needed to turn down in volume instead of up all or nearly all the way . Now that I'm retired I'm looking forward to listening to a lot of music before needing to recharge instead of worrying do I have enough power left to complete a call to tech support before my earbuds drop me from completing a call.
"December 21, 2020",JOANN,5.0,,These are so much more comfortable than the earbuds without ear hooks.  I can wear a hat (cold weather) and the ear bud would fall out.  No problem with comfortable ear hook.  Picks up phone calls easily.  Sound quality excellent.  Case is a nice size so will not lose.  This is 3rd pair I have bought and think it will be last.
"March 21, 2021",Carpetbagger,5.0,,"I really like this item.  They have great sound.  They are comfortable, as they clip over my ears so I don't have to push them into my ear canal.  They hold a charge well.  I would purchase them again if I lose them which would be pretty hard to do."
"April 12, 2021",Alexandro,5.0,11,They are compact and very easy to use right out of the box. I use them alot for work all 8 hours and when I am out and about outside running or exercising at the gym. This would be my second pair my brother wanted my first ones and so gave it to him but let me tell you sound is really good the ear buds are really light and they hold on securely around the ear. Yes I do forget they are even on which is scary at times 🤣 cuz I forget i got them on but still. They are really good for the price 😊
"January 22, 2021",CNinIA,5.0,,"Good product, they fit well around the ears and are flexible in size. I had a little trouble figuring out how to go from pairing one at a time to both sides, since either earpiece can work independently of the other. Overall really great product, would get it again."
"October 13, 2020",RAZOR,5.0,,"I ordered this product cause i needed earbuds that wont fall off my ears when jogging. they stay in place perfectly, the sound in incredible and they block out reasonably amount of sound. I dont jog all day so cant say much bout battery life but i walk a few hours also with great connection for what i need them for."
"September 11, 2020",Stephen K.,5.0,,I needed a good pair of headphones to use and didn't want to spend the money on a more expensive pair. I've been using them so far for virtual zooming and also for going for runs outside.  They've worked great and easily in both scenarios connecting to my laptop and then to my phone. Only downside (and it's probably the case with other types of bluetooth headphones) is that I have to unpair them from one device for them to be able to be paired and connected to the other - but it takes 2 seconds to do that so really not a big deal.
"January 20, 2021",Nick,2.0,,"Left earbud stopped working last month after 3 months of use; the charging station would not recognize the ear bud was properly connected. I contacted customer service and they sent me a replacement pair; however, the right earbud stopped working after one week of use. I cannot pair the left and right of the two respective pairs that are working since they came from different sets; oh well! Great customer service, but I'm not going to bother requesting another pair."
"May 10, 2021",Matt,5.0,,"Recently purchased these bluetooth headphones and I am so glad that I did! The battery life is excellent. After one charge I am able to use the headphones for various work calls throughout the day, as well as a 2-hour gym session. They fit comfortably at the gym and I don't have to worry about them falling out. The sound quality is great for the price as well. I definitely recommend purchasing."
"February 7, 2021",Robin Howell-Ulrick,2.0,,"Pretty lousy sound, distorted, tinny. As all ear buds I've used they don't stay in an optimal spot in the ear, if I shove it in tight it sounds OK but a minute later it has moved and sounds really thin. Even in the best spot they still don't sound good."
"December 11, 2020",Anthony,2.0,,"These don't have a microphone, which makes me really angry honestly since I bought them so I can use them for wireless calls at work as well as gaming for when I'm home. Now I'll only wear them when I workout. They look really nice, but they are audio only."
"October 24, 2020",Bryan H Wilson,5.0,,"I was skeptical of the quality of these earphones for the price but am pleasently surprised! They are very lightweight and comfortable, sound quality is exceptional. I had a small issue with the volume control but customer service was in touch within hours and I am most satisfied."
"January 4, 2021",Emilpjech,5.0,,"other earphones have not worked at all with my ACER laptop.  The Occiam set paired with my laptop immediately.  I do online Psychotherapy and having these wireless earbuds  is a great addition for me.  The earphones fitting on around my ears is a very good fit also.  So far (2 hours) I have not been able to pair with my MotoG7 phone so I will check with Motog and with Occiam as needed to get the pairing done.  These are an excellent fit and good sound, not matched at all other wireless units I have tried."
"December 30, 2020",fayth,5.0,,"Awesome earbuds! Comfortable fit, easy one time syncing to my phone, LOVE the battery display on the included charging dock. Great audio, my friends don't complain that I sound far away or they can hear themselves while I am using these. Worth the price and would def buy again!"
"July 4, 2021",MusicBandFan,3.0,,"I don't often write reviews.  I bought these at the end of May.  I went to use them today and the right earbud is completely dead.  It will not turn on.  When I place them in the charging case only the left earbud charges.  I cleaned the contacts and still nothing..  And the return window just closed 2 weeks ago.  So basically I spent the money and got 5 weeks use only.  I feel ripped off. Update:  I contacted them and they agreed to send a replament, so move from 1 to 3 stars.  If the replacement works for at least 3 months I will move stars up further."
"June 27, 2021",Keki,3.0,,"These earbuds do not have a lot of bass as stated In the description. Also, the display on my pair only showed one time.  However, I did like how lightweight they were compared to other earbuds that I have. If you don’t care much for bass, then I’d definitely say go for it!"
"June 15, 2021",Panthermania,4.0,,I love that these earbuds can’t fall off of my ear. The sound quality is good.  The only problem is when I use them to talk on the phone. Callers say that I sound like I’m far away or that someone has their hand over my mouth. That’s my only issue.
"May 28, 2021",Bob Olsen,5.0,,"I paired this up last night and it sounded better than I thought it would.  So I tested it against Soundpeats and the standard wired headphones that come with apple products.  And it was excellent, beating the apple and pretty much the same as the more expensive Soundpeat product.  It's dialed in now with a earbud change and will be to 'go to' during exercise workouts.  Glad I found this one."
"March 13, 2021",DrunkenGamer67,5.0,,"I've always had challenges with earbuds.  Before the Occiams, I could never find a pair that would stay in my ears while I did chores or performed other tasks.  The hooks fit closely enough to make sure they don't budge, but not too closely. That way I don't get that ache behind my neck from extended wear.  I also find the bluetooth connection to be lightning fast.  No more tapping my toes while waiting to listen to a podcast."
"September 15, 2020",Jon Bowker,5.0,,"I had to pair them with my phone a couple times and the battery life wasn't great at first, but after a couple uses and recharges they are performing great. Don't write them off if they don't meet expectations on their first use. Sound is great with both music and phone calls. Earbud hooks fit comfortably over my ears and barely notice I have them on. Being able to recharge the earbuds in the charging case without a wall outlet is convenient. A fully charged case can recharge the earbuds 4 or 5 times before needing to be recharged itself. Customer support has been very responsive while I worked through my issues elevating their value beyond what could have been just a set of low priced headphones."
"March 30, 2021",Virginia,5.0,,"Great headphones, sound is great and they feel very comfortable wearing. Case is sturdy and strong. Updated After 3 months they stopped working. I really like these but sad cause sound will not come out of headphones now but they connect to Bluetooth still."
"March 12, 2021",TOSU_Buckeye,5.0,,"I have other earbuds these seem to work. Others seem to not disconnect once I put them in the container once I put them in secure they disconnect. So far I really like them, the only issue that I have I wish I can connect them to two devices. like a tablet and I am enjoy reading and listen to a book and my phone if someone calls I can answer the call."
"June 27, 2021",jon pierre,5.0,,"These are excellent earbuds! I personally like the over the ear hook. I do yard work around the house and they are very secure. I could tell the difference in sound quality and comfort the moment I put these on. The battery lasted for hours too. A great product, value and feel. Jon"
"February 9, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Instant Bluetooth connection without any hassle. Nice sound quality. Could be a tiny bit louder but other than that I am happy. Took me a bit to get used to the way they sit  on your ear. Once they are on they stay on and  Are very comfortable. All in all a good deal .
"January 13, 2021",Travis T.,4.0,,"These were easy to set up and get connected, no issues during the setup process.  The sound quality is decent, it's not as crisp as high quality head phones or earbuds, but the bass on them is good.  They don't have a ""hollow"" noise feel to them, the sound is full, just not as crisp as I would like.  But for the price and the fact that they're bluetooth, I'll give them a pass. Overall they're pretty solid, if you're looking for some cheap, wireless earbuds, with decent sound, then these are the buds to get."
"November 14, 2020",Michael Tifft,5.0,,"I needed something with amazing battery for work. The pair I was using died in less than 3 hours from a full charge. I've used these T17 for over 5 hours of PC videos and they were still going. The feel is decent and the volume is perfect. Love the case, just be carefuly, the hinge on the case can be weak BUT it doesn't effect the charging and clips right back in, may not stay perfectly but that is the only downside I have found and trust me I've been looking as I do with all products to review them."
"January 18, 2021",Tony Girmscheid,5.0,,"So far so good. For a $30 pair of earbuds, they are certainly loud and have great bass to them. I do have a small issue with the mid range of them and how finicky they are in my ears while Im stretching. While Im running, they stay in place and sound great! As far as customer service so far, Sammi Chen is a 5 star rep!"
"February 4, 2021",Nikhil Sastry,5.0,,The quality is great. I really like that the case shows me the charge of the ear phones. My only complaint is that the case is too smooth and slippery. It falls out of my pocket way too easily. Still a 5/5 purchase. I'm also writing this review to complete the steps for warranty. Apparently I get a 2nd set of earphones for free for doing so. Seems like a great deal to me.
"June 26, 2021",Chris Calder,5.0,,"Definitely the best headphones I have ever purchased!! Sound quality is amazing! Battery last all day I've had them for 3 days and have only charged once. The customer service for Occlaim is one of the best, would definitely recommend."
"October 26, 2020",Sharon B.,5.0,One,"I really like headphones! I cannot wear the earbuds like apple makes because I had ear surgery &a small part of my ear is not there to hold them in, so I was looking fir earphones that attach to my ear but yet are hidden! I use these all the time for phone calls when I’m driving or working so I am hands free! The sound is really great! I tried another brand but they had a glitch in them ever so often but these don’t! Great quality! Sharon B."
"June 20, 2021",Smitty,5.0,One,"I have a tendency to destroy headphones and ear buds. These in particular are secure, easy to use, sounds quality is there and affordable. I've been thru, at least, a dozen pair of ear buds from Amazon, these are my favorites. Take that for what  it's worth."
"March 23, 2021",S.Harris,5.0,,Finally found some earbuds that I can wear!! I have small ear canals and lobes so trying to find the right earbuds has always been a challenge for me until now. I can wear these and exercise without them falling out. I use to have to wear headphones and that was a headache. I'm so glad I've found these!!
"January 22, 2021",Anthony Nguyen,5.0,,"These Occiam earbuds are awesome! The sound quality is so crisp and clear. I have the Galaxy earbuds which I got for $200 isnt even as clear as these ones. You can turn the volume to max and no static whatsoever. I've been working out with it for 2hrs a day for the past 3 days and the battery is still at 100% because the case charges the earbuds. You can't go wrong with these. 5 stars for this product. Customer service is awesome as well. If you email them, they response to you within hours."
"February 19, 2021",Linda,5.0,,I bought these for my husband. He has an ear condition so he has a problem with things in his ear but he loves these earphones. The sound is great and the fit is wonderful. With 3 sizes of inserts he was able to reduce the size of the bud going into his ear. Perfect and super fast delivery.
"March 23, 2021",Heather C. Beaufait,5.0,,"Very happy with this purchase! These headphones work great and come with 3 sizes of tips so everyone should be able to find the right fit. Great sound, easy to pair with my phone. These will help me while I study, and with being hands-free while I drive. And all at a Great low price! Thanks!"
"November 7, 2020",Brenda,5.0,,Ear buds came in a nice case that is also the recharging station. They  fit comfortably in my ears and stay put even at 65mph on motorcycle. They pair quickly and have a great sound. I charged them to 100% and listened to music for about 4 hours and battery was still at 80%. I would easily recommend these.
"March 22, 2021",Paul Rollinger,5.0,,"I first bought these earbuds, and loved them from the start. GREAT sound and LONG LONG battery life. Then I lost them on my way home from work. I contacted the seller and without hesitation, they express shipped me a brand new pair! AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE! THEY CARE! The new pair sound just as great! FIVE STARS FOR THIS COMPANY!!!!"
"July 2, 2021",bigrob70,2.0,,"I guess these would be good for talking on the phone or for basic music. I was misled into believing that they actually had BASS because the advertisement says so. Positive note quick delivery, nice case and they fit comfortably. Will return for something different."
"April 17, 2021",Jeorgia,5.0,,"It says 30 feet distance, I have been able to go up to 40 feet. I highly recommend these. They are very comfortable. Good quality sound. I use these in my mowing business and no problems with equipment sound drowning out them."
"March 18, 2021",DNoble,3.0,,"Unfortunately these didn't fit me. It seems my ears are to small so the hook corner would stick out too much, no matter the position I tried. I even asked my husband to try it on and on him it fit great. Because of this problem, it would also fall really easily. Another issue I encountered is that the buttons make a very loud clicking sound when you press them, which was quite annoying."
"May 7, 2021",Benjamin,1.0,,"I got these for my GF a couple weeks ago. The sound is kind of ""meh,"" but she was happy to have a charging case, because her old BTs were always dying. Neither bud has been damaged, or gotten dirty, and the left bud already has to be pushed down to charge. We've re-cleaned the buds, the case, etc... We have done everything we can think of, but nothing works.  Now she has to put some paper over the left earbud, and use a rubberband to close the case so both buds will charge. Buy at your own risk.  This happened after just 2 weeks."
"May 20, 2021",William H.,1.0,,"So the reviews were good so i choose to purchase.  First set lasted for about 2 week before one would not charge.  So i requested an exchange and received a new set.  By day 5 with the new set one earbud will not turn on.  All i use them for is running and only maybe 40 minutes per day.  Yes i completely charged them before using them.  The second set the right earbud won't even register being in the case.  I guess I will request a refund and send these back and look for a different set.  They sound is nice when they work, wish they would have lasted."
"November 29, 2020",Amanda F,5.0,,"I was waiting for a $35 set of earbuds, however these are easily worth twice as much. I have issues with earbuds hurting my ears and giving me headaches after using them for too long. I wore these for 8 hours straight yesterday and no pain or headache. Would recommend to anyone looking for good reasonably priced bluetooth earphones."
"April 6, 2021",Allyson Sal,5.0,,"My husband ordered these headphones when his original pair, that he loved, got wet and stopped working.  He is so impressed with these!! He has been using them for a few days and has not had any problems. They synced up to his phone easily and the battery lasts all day for him.  They fit snugly in his ear, which historically with headphones, had been his biggest problem.  We will definitely be ordering them for all 4 of us!"
"March 26, 2021",Lilian G.,2.0,,"I love that is good to listen to music very good. The only thing is that when I talk on the phone, people can hear me very well I have to talk loud in order for them to hear me. The battery life is good it reasonable. I love the charging box because you can charge the bluetooth up to 3 times with out charging the box. That's a plus!  It all depends how you use it! I love that you don't need the 2 buds to use it."
"June 18, 2021",jourdan dorsey,1.0,,"No idea how these headphones have such a high rating. Within 10 seconds of using them I thought they were blown. They weren't. The sound quality is just that bad. Even after adjusting my EQ they still were unbearable. So much ""bass"" that you can barely make out any of the other instruments."
"December 9, 2020",Odiddy76,5.0,,"These headphones are a really good value. They paired easily via Bluetooth without any issues. They are comfortable to wear even after several hours. I used these for an extended session on the golf driving range and they stayed in place and didn't fall out. I also used them on both the treadmill and elliptical machine while working out and also no issues with them staying in place. Plus, they have an incredible battery life. For the price these headphones are a really good value."
"May 25, 2021",Michael Mcalpin,5.0,,"Excellent sound quality and they paired with every phone, tablet and TV in the house! Very comfortable in the ears and the noise canceling is really nice once seated in the ear. Very happy with this set of ear buds from occiam."
"December 7, 2020",Chris,5.0,,I bought these for my husbands birthday and he absolutely loved them. He’s impressed with how comfortable they are and how they fit perfectly. The battery life is amazing and the sound quality is also really good. And the charging case is small so it’s easy to carry around!
"May 12, 2021",Shelly A Songstad,3.0,,"Pros: -The sound quality is good for the price. -They're fairly comfortable to wear Cons: -I bought these partly to use for conference calls. I've been told by multiple people that the audio coming through the mic is very quiet and muffled. These still work well for music, but I'll probably get a different set to use for phone calls. -The built in notifications (power on, power off, low battery, etc) are extremely loud! You can't turn it down that I'm aware of, it hurts my ears when it tells me I have an incoming call or the battery is low."
"November 28, 2020",Kiff Whistler,5.0,,These fir the ear comfortably and do not irritate it. Controls and connection of these is easy and I used these on my laptop for gaming and I could hear them well but they could barely hear me but I fixed that in pc system setting under device master volume. Love that the case can be charged and charge the earbuds without being plugged in. However does not work well for phone calls. Mostly beat for listening to music or gaming.
"October 23, 2020",Hiya,1.0,,Really like these headphones! I needed headphones that securely wrapped around my ear! Buying these for my mom so its easier for her to pick up the phone and dance while cleaning. UPDATE. THEY SEND YOU AN EMAIL TO GET FREE HEADPHONES IF YOU DO THE REVIEW.  ITS BEEN OVER 6MONTHS AND NO HEADPHONES They are flimsy. Still work just the case is flimsy
"May 2, 2021",Stonemeadow,5.0,,"I tried to find any device for sound that wouldn't squish my head, mess up my glasses, or hurt my ears. Plus, I have been disappointed with the clarity and bass for products that said they had both. These earbuds check all of the boxes I needed at a fraction of the price. Super easy and you can even sync one earbud at a time. They charge very quickly too. The bass, while not of BOSE quality it's noticeable but doesn't tire your ears, the clarity is incredible."
"June 14, 2021",LeMoe,3.0,,"This item is great for listening to music but terrible for phone calls. The person on the people on the phone can't hear me good. I gave up using them for phone calls. They're great for listening for music. They are loud enough to use while mowing my grass. I kept them for that reason and switch to speaker phone for phone calls. I use another bluetooth  device for phone calls. You decide if they are worth it. They do offer free returns. Unless I got a defective pair, they are no good for phone calls."
"May 2, 2021",Mommydoctor,5.0,,"I actually bought these earbuds for my dad. He regularly uses them to facetime with us and the sound quality from the microphone is very clear. He also likes the audio quality, but I can't personally vouch for it :)"
"June 22, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it claims to have deep bass, the bass is not noticeable at all, otherwise these are really great buds, fit is great, functions are outstanding and the ear loop is perfect. I own a pair of NYC Apollo 1 earbuds and the bass in those is unfreaking believable, but they are not a behind the ear design so the the fit and ability to stay in ( for me ) are terrible, but the bass !! Oh my"
"February 25, 2021",Dr. Dave,5.0,,"So far these are staying on and are very comfortable.  The volume up and down buttons have a slight delay after pressing the buttons before the volume changes.  They also don't gradually change the volume, but increase or decrease in steps of 6%.  So pressing and holding the volume buttons does nothing - you need to quick press once and wait for the change, then press again to continue making changes.  For the price the fit and sound quality is good."
"May 22, 2021",Carrie J. Pegg,5.0,,"The first pair didn't have great sound quality, sounded like blown speakers even though I play my music at low volume when I run so I can hear my environment still. They quickly sent out a second pair, much better. Very comfortable fit and good sound, charges well."
"January 21, 2021",Shaista salim,5.0,,Sound quality is good with noice cancellation and battery life is good. This is a wonderful product! They are very comfortable with a bendable rubber piece that wraps around the ear. The directions are easy to figure out with the pamphlet included. The sound quality is good for the price. I love the compact case that shows the battery life for each ear (which lasts long). All in all 10/10.
"March 22, 2021",Smith's,5.0,,"Great earbuds ,sound is great,they are very comfortable too.im very happy I purchased these.the bass on them is great also not crackling.ive bought multiple pairs of earbuds these are way better then the expensive Samsung buds"
"January 10, 2021",Katrina,5.0,,"They sound really good, easy to use, and comfortable on my ears. So I originally gave low stars because of the case but I was sent a new one. The problem is you have to use the short cord it comes with...it will not charge using other c chargers."
"February 28, 2021",paper,5.0,One,This product does exactly what it says it will do. Nice sound long battery life. So far so good I would recommend this product.
"January 18, 2021",Ashley,5.0,,"Great fit on my ears. I love the multiple sizes of caps. The sound is very good and the noise cancelling is very good. I haven't had an trouble with the bluetooth connection, and I haven't heard any songs skipping either. I would buy these again."
"October 21, 2020",William McGahan,5.0,,Well it’s hard for me to give a review because I was riding my motorcycle wearing it and arm I tried to turn the volume up and it fell out of my ear and I lost it on I don’t know if the volumes loud enough for me I’m hard of hearing I was impressed by the products the case the charger and how easy it was to enter Bluetooth into it but that’s my final
"April 22, 2021",Katrina Johnston,1.0,2,All the 5 stars are true but I bought them around Christmas and now one ear bud doesn't work at all. Don't know how to get them replaced already did a review and haven't heard anything from the manufacturers or Amazon very not happy about this product
"February 1, 2021",Regg,5.0,,"Excellence. Never heard of the Brand but I traded Skull Candy's Jib because they keo falling out my ears. I must say that these are a MAJOR Upgrade. Easy connect, a dial to show power level, ease of controls. Very happy with them. Can't comment on battery yet."
"February 11, 2021",Mark Amos,4.0,,"The sound quality is good, I have heard callers say I sound like I’m in a tunnel, but I hear them fine. I like the fact they stay in place and the individual pairing is nice when I don’t want to wear both. Battery life is great so far."
"May 12, 2021",LadyoftheHouse,5.0,,"So far so good. Easy to pair and use. Lightweight but seems secure. Pretty comfy too. Also, super honest seller. Somehow I was accidentally charged twice, and one was immediately refunded without hesitation, before I even realized what had happened."
"January 19, 2021",Mario S.,4.0,,"Great sound quality for movies and music, especially when you use both earbuds together. The fit is very good and stays in place during physical activity. As I was watching a movie I was amazed at the sounds they pick up, down to the most minute and unique background sounds. I'm very happy with all aspects of these earbuds and at a terrific price. I highly recommend them!!!"
"October 13, 2020",Amazon Purchaser,5.0,,These ear buds are really a great value. I've tried many low cost wireless buds but these have the best sound combined with exceptional battery life.  I would highly recommend them if you don't want to pay for name brands.  The photo I posted is after about 4 hrs of use 3 weeks ago. They are still at 51% !
"November 14, 2020",Brandon hinson,5.0,,I was looking for a set of over the ear earbuds as my current ones don't like to stay in when I'm moving around and all. I came across these and was curious. One thing I really liked was each earbud could be used independently. Ive had them for a few days now and am enjoying them. Sound quality is awesome. I would recommend these. Update: To add to this I did run into a small issue with the earbuds. Contacted their customer service and they took care of it.
"June 24, 2021",DG,1.0,,"When I first received these, I was pleased.  They were convenient to use and the sound quality was very good.  Recently, however, I can use them for awhile and they are fine until I return them to the case.  They will not work when I remove them from the case.  The display is blank. When I plug in the case, it shows there is 0 power. They will charge quickly and then work well, until they return to the case.  Basically, they only work after being removed from a freshly charged case.  This is a problem even if only used for a short time."
"June 23, 2021",Cindy,5.0,,They fit nicely. I haven’t had a chance to use them but I like the look and they came fully charged. Update - It took me a couple minutes to pair the two together but I finally got it. The sound is great.
"May 28, 2021",Karen,1.0,One,Absolute garbage headphones ! Don’t waste your time and money. I bought two pairs and both stopped charging and wouldn’t turn on. The company will also harass you to delete negative comments so don’t be fooled by the “good” stars !
"March 29, 2021",Kelley,5.0,,"Great headphones! I previously had wireless Bluetooth headphones that were just so sensitive & would always fall out of my ears while at the gym. These ones, after a long search mind you, are perfect! Sound quality is great, they fit & stay on my ears even when I am running, and have a very secure carrying case. Definitely happy with my purchase & would do so again should I ever need new headphones!"
"January 29, 2021",Mark Anthony,5.0,,"Very happy with the purchase. Headphones charge quickly. Great design. Headphones do not fall out of my ears, they are great for my ears. An interesting, stylish headphone box. All the functions of these headphones work correctly. The sound is good, good deep bass. I like listening to music on these headphones, super."
"June 15, 2021",Ms. E,5.0,,"I love these earbuds, they are light weight, almost forget I'm wearing them.  The sound quality is amazing.  Seriously, got these for a steal.  Thank you Amazon.  Way to go.  Almost forgot to mention, easy to operate."
"May 11, 2021",Ken Mulligan,1.0,,"It happens in one ear at a time.  The slightest movement of your head precipitates it.  Let's say you are on the treadmill. Or working out and you lay on the bench.  Your mistake.  Just then, she says, albeit sensuously, and in one year, ""connected."" Then again. And again. While you are trying to pump out the weights or run and listen to theaudiobook in the other ear.  Time to take a break to reset the earphones. Repeat this every 20 minutes ad infinitum. If this sounds appealing, these earphones are for you."
"February 5, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,"Good earbuds.  I like how they have the over-the-ear feature so that they don't fall out easily.  I also like that the charging case will show you how much battery life you have left.  Got them as a gift for my son, and he is happy!"
"December 2, 2020",joel guevarra,4.0,,These are pretty nice earphones for the price. The battery last pretty long and the earpieces fit snug but comfortable. Stays on even my ears even during intense workouts. The sound quality is below average however for under $30 its to be expected.
"February 25, 2021",Darryl Murphy,3.0,,I dislike the fact that it connects to the computer then out of nowhere I hear (loudly I may add) disconnected. When charging it does not charge well. The sound quality and noise cancellation are great. Now if I can only get it to stay connected.
"April 28, 2021",Chi Chi,1.0,2,"The sound is a bit ""muffled."" Also, when I have an in-coming call, the vocal alert is excessively loud! I can't turn it down. The rubber ear pieces are ""suction-y"" on my ear canal, no matter what size I use."
"June 10, 2021",pdeagle,5.0,,I just received the earbuds and they were easy to pair and sound just fine for my needs. The ultimate test was they were comfortable to wear during my 5mile walk today. A big improvement over my last pair.
"June 6, 2021",JK,1.0,,"So I used them at the gym for a couple weeks without issue, and while the fidelity was not great, they served the purpose. Then one earbud began to occasionally conk out for no apparent reason. Putting it back in the case would eventually bring it back to life. Then it started happening regularly. Then it happened with both earbuds. The seller claims these are waterproof, but that is not my experience. Had to pitch them in the trash after six weeks. Not suitable for use while working out, at least not for those of us who sweat..."
"January 22, 2021",DArcher007,4.0,,"I was looking for over-the-ear bluetooth headphones for running/hiking and these fit the bill! Other models are a pain to charge because you don't know when it's done until the light changes, but Occiam gives you the exact % of the charge. If you're looking for top-of-the-line quality, this isn't it. But in the under $50, you're unlikely to find a better bang for your buck. No complaints!"
"March 1, 2021",David,4.0,,"The headphones themselves are great - good sound - good battery life, etc. My only complaint is the fact that when the case for the headphones is opened and oriented to take them out - the Right and Left are backwards. This isn't an issue for extended use but can be frustrating when taking them out of the case multiple times a day."
"March 22, 2021",James S,5.0,,"I run around 5 miles 4 days a week.  I was so tired of being attached to my phone via a cord, but had bad luck with other wireless ear buds.  I've got 10 runs under my belt with these headphones, and i couldn't be happier.  One button click and they automatically connect to my phone - it is so freeing!  I can't vouch for their performance with music (I listen to mainly podcasts and talk shows), but i would buy them again in a heart beat - thanks!"
"July 14, 2021",GB,1.0,,"I have done multiple troubleshooting efforts and these headphones are just junk.  They won's auto connect to any device as they indicated they would, constantly skips music when walking/running, and the full battery really only gives you ~1h of listening time. When you do get it in the sweet spot and tings are working...just don't move and enjoy the music"
"February 27, 2021",Bill,5.0,,Great pair of ear buds!  I'm no audiophile but I know what I like. These have great sound pair easily and the battery life is awfully darn good. I wear these while jogging and they fit comfortably and securely. They have enough noise canceling so one can enjoy whatever you are listening to but you can still hear background sounds for your own safety. Great value for the price.
"March 25, 2021",Ana A.,5.0,,I love these earphones! I like how there is a screen to tell you how much charge is left In the case and lights that let you know how charged each separate earphone is. The sounds is great too! I would highly recommend!
"March 25, 2021",Wanda,5.0,,"Just received, so far I’m impressed. Bought for my husband as a gift. Was easy to pair with his phone and he likes the quality of the sound and look of the product. He is enjoying so far and said he looks forward to using."
"May 28, 2021",MedUSA,4.0,,Love the long 8 hour listening per charge.  Good price. Lifetime warranty.  They sit nicely over and in my ears.  Only negative is they don’t block outside noise but For the price these are a great buy.
"July 13, 2021",Miami Architect,5.0,,I now have about 3 of these types (over the ear).  I especially like this pair with the percentage indicator telling me the battery life.  Sound is good like all of these types.  Great value for the dollar.
"April 2, 2021",Tryle Enderor,5.0,,"The good: impressive battery life, decent sound quality, and it's pretty good at reducing noise. Innovative synching between the buds. Stays attached well, even during vigorous exercise. The not-so-good: volume switches are hit or miss, and the battery fell out of the carry case once within the first month. Furthermore, when the battery dies, there's no warning during use. I use these ear buds when running or working in the yard. Range is a little shorter than I'd like (around 20ft), but is sufficient for most of my needs."
"June 6, 2021",BGrafflin,4.0,,"For most of the time these work out very well, but there is an occasional skip of sound.  For the most part it's not a problem to me, but it is annoying if if it's a good part of music that gets missed."
"March 22, 2021",HELEN S. PRADIA,5.0,,The headphones fit perfectly. I have small ears and usually have problems keeping them end my ear. These Occiam blue tooth are perfect. I will order another one to have an extra. The charge doesn’t last long.
"May 30, 2021",Sarah,4.0,,"I absolutely love the headphones, really does cancel out the noise. And I love the buttons on the side, other headphones with the touch zone for volume and skip would pause when my hair touched it....so annoying! My only complaint about these is the case. It's so smooth and my clumsy ass has dropped it about 5 times already and broken the top. It still charges and works, which is great. And the battery life on these bad boys is outstanding. Just be aware if you're a butterfingers like I am lol. But honestly, great headphones!"
"December 17, 2020",J. J.,4.0,,Its only been a couple months but my wife loves it and asked me to leave a positive review for it. It is comfortable for her and the battery life is pretty good for her use (she has online classes and can listen to her teacher while she's doing something else around the house)
"May 6, 2021",DaveNFL,5.0,,"Purchased these as a Christmas gift and they are outstanding, every bit the build and sound quality of earbuds costing well over a hundred dollars and more.  Highly recommend you give them a try.  Also really comfortable."
"May 27, 2021",ThaQueen,5.0,,"These earbuds get rave reviews from me. They are comfortable, over the ear secure feature, have long listening life and the sound quality is the best feature.  I wholeheartedly recommend these ear buds."
"March 2, 2021",The Southern Cook,5.0,,"I wanted something to allow me to watch movies on my iPad while hubby watches his tv shows. These work great! I can’t hear the tv while sitting in the same room. No problems setting them up or charging. They fit my ear perfectly and since they have a soft hook over ear, no more ear buds popping out! The sound is fine for me. There is not a lot of bass, but that suits me well!"
"February 3, 2021",M. Hasson,4.0,,"The only shortcoming for me is the placement of buttons. I prefer the volume and ""next"" buttons to be on top of the earpiece so I can use both fingers to press it. On here they are on the side, so if I press them it just jams the earpiece further into my ear and it's hard to grip. Otherwise I agree with the other positive reviews about the audio."
"February 10, 2021",Keith D. Keller,5.0,,Really like these affordable earbuds.  They are great to wear during my daily workouts and walks.  And the recharging case is great for keeping the headphones charged during storage or while traveling.  Highly recommend them.
"March 28, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I took very good care of these, and they only lasted 3 months. They connect and they charge, but there is no sound. For a couple days, it was cutting in and out, but now they just don’t work at all. Definitely not worth it."
"November 25, 2020",Chulo,5.0,7,These headset are so amazing for me. It’s hard to get headphone that can stay in my ears so these go over your ear so it’s great. I had over a month and just charged them a second time. I used them at work mostly so not a lot of use but they are awesome. For the price u can’t beat. Quality is great case is bulk n big but it’s ok for me. Love them
"April 7, 2021",Ryan Oliver,5.0,,Had these for a bit more than a month now and they've been great. I can use just one while my baby rests on my other shoulder for a nap. Or I can use both at the office to listen to music while no one else is disturbed by 2000's Eminem. Super happy with the purchase.
"January 11, 2021",Schemickia,5.0,,Wonderful product my husband absolutely loves these earbuds they are wireless such a great buy. Connected right away to his phone and easy to use instructions. What are you waiting for go get you a pair you will not be disappointed.
"January 30, 2021",Scott S. Hadick,5.0,,I had been searching for a while to find an inexpensive set of Bluetooth ear buds that were reasonably priced.  I took a chance on the Occiam Bluetooth Headphones because of the great reviews & low price.  I was able to easily & quickly link these earbuds to my iPod Nano & they have delivered high quality sound for all my music.  I highly recommend this product!  Especially if you want a high quality product at a extremely reasonable price.
"November 3, 2020",Kalico,5.0,,"Love the comfortable fit,now I don't feel like im going to lose one everytime I wear them I feel safe with these in my ear for sure! The sound quality is also really crisp and clear and pairs instantly, you definitely are getting more for your money with these earbuds! Finally the search is over. Ps. Battery life is fantastic!"
"December 31, 2020",Ineedtogetoffamazon,5.0,,These are great and I love they got around your ear since other earbuds and pods fall out of my ears all the time I have no issues connecting to devices and the battery life is amazing
"February 22, 2021",Kindle Customer,4.0,,I have gotten good feedback on the microphone sound quality. Sounds is very good for the price which is 1/6th of AirPods. Well worth the purchase and the over the ear makes sure the headphones don’t come off while working out.
"January 11, 2021",Brian Howland,5.0,15,"Great for running, doesn't slip around because of the loop and rubber ear bud.  They are nice and small so they fit easily under hats.  Great sound, deep base"
"December 27, 2020",MK,5.0,,"One of the main reasons I bought this was because my other headphone's microphone did not work well. But this one does work and the person I talked to through this headphone said that they could hear me well. Besides, the other features seem to be working properly."
"December 6, 2020",Brazil,4.0,,"So the only issue I have with these are if you lose the carrying case they come in which is also the batter charger you can’t charge them anymore.  I understand the concept of them charging in it, but I wish one ear bud could b also charged without the case. Other then that they are good."
"January 24, 2021",Doug O.,5.0,,"I bought these to use when I'm riding my motorcycle so I can listen to Audible or music on my iPhone. Not too distracting, I can still hear traffic around me. Great when cruising back roads, not so much freeways as they are too loud."
"March 7, 2021",xviiiscore,5.0,,"Arrived on time as described. Easy to pair and so far work great. The over the ear piece is barely noticeable but I’m glad it’s there. I was tired of my other ear buds falling out while talking or eating. So far, so good."
"May 24, 2021",Marja,5.0,,"These earbuds are amazing. Very happy with my purchase. Finally some that fit and won't fall out. Also, wearing glasses is no problem at all. I like using them together or separate. The sound is great as well. The cute little charging box slips easily in my bag. It's also nice that you can just stop play and pop them into the box for charging. No need to disconnect. Lastly, what made me go for this particular pair is the look. No flashy colors, just plain elegant design with easy buttons."
"January 26, 2021",Hector,5.0,,"Good product... last a lot of hours... most of the time i use only one, so when one gets low on battery i use the other one and put to charge the other. Fit very good. Good sound quality. Perfect gift for a friend"
"December 29, 2020",Politically Incorrect,2.0,One,There is no bass… Charging case will not charge Volume change tone does not work all the time
"January 13, 2021",Brad J. Biggar,5.0,,Got these yesterday. Very easy to set-up and sound quality is far better then the ones that came with my S20. Like them so much after a days use I ordered a set for my wife. For forty dollars you can't really go wrong. Update after 2 1/2 months. The middle charging pin for the left bud either broke it's spring or just plain old got stuck. Now the left bud won't charge. The scratches if the picture are from me trying to get it to pop back up. Past Amazon's return window.
"March 22, 2021",H. Fredell,3.0,,"First day. Fit is ok and feels like they’ll stay in place while excercising or outdoor activities. Call quality and audiobook/podcast was good. However, for music, these are just too tinny and have almost no bass."
"February 24, 2021",TA,5.0,One,"I just received these earbuds, the sound is very clear, and the fit is very comfortable!"
"June 19, 2021",Pmkilk,5.0,,"I just received the T17 ear buds and I love them.  They are comfortable and the sound is great.  One good advantage is that they will not fall off, as my last earbuds did, when I was walking along the beach and they fell into the water.  I would recommend them to anyone."
"March 17, 2021",Callherkee,5.0,,Yes I am thrilled about my new earbuds. So far others do not hear all the noise in the background from my grandchildren. I work 8 hour shift with an hour each way  battery life is great. The only issues securing better around the ears
"December 8, 2020",Zolas,5.0,,"Seriously, right out of the box these felt and looked like great quality. Crazy easy to connect to my phone, the sound was great when I turned on my music and my phone calls were crisp and clear on both sides! Stoked... I bought these for snowboarding so I'll update you on your week these work after this weekend!!"
"February 15, 2021",Anita Matuszewski,5.0,,Great product!  I use these while cleaning around the house to listen podcast. They stay in my ears and don’t fall out like my previous pair I had. Sound quality is great and the battery life is long. Hooked up easily to my Apple Watch.
"November 12, 2020",Lisa Disantos,5.0,,"This is my first pair of comfortable Bluetooth earphones, and I am NEVER going back.  I love how I have options!  Free hands, listening in one ear, charging the other simultaneously, and pairing to a variety of devices... No only that, but these earphones fit better than any other wired or wireless earbuds I've ever tried.  That's over the course of at least 5 years. Great quality, wonderful experience... I don't typically write reviews, but these earbuds are definitely worth their price."
"February 3, 2021",Bob,4.0,,"I use my ear buds every day on my walk. And every day one side or the other will stop, no sound.After a couple 100 yards or so it will come back to life but the ear buds are out of sink giving a eco effect. This goes on for a few minutes then they will sink up again. Also one side or the other will continue to blank out and come back on it gets so bad sometimes that I turn one the problem side off for awhile this usually fixes the issue. Over all they performs will with no other problems."
"November 12, 2020",Scubasammy,5.0,,"These headphones are super cool and function really well. The sound is clear and I use them while on my exercise bike, and I can hear my program perfectly. Very nice chic case. Great battery life panel. These hooked up very easily to my phone. Great buy!"
"February 7, 2021",Pauline,3.0,One,"Ok headphones. Crappy battery life. I was under the impression each headphone had 8 hours... They have 8 hours COMBINED. Using both of them on regular calls, I get about 4 hours average for each headphone."
"January 28, 2021",Holly,5.0,,"Absolutely love these headphones! I was a bit surprised to see the updated USB-C cable, but I’m not mad about it. I love that I can see the percentage charged; my other Bluetooth headphones didn’t have that and it was always a gamble if I wanted just one headphone to listen on mono. I haven’t had these headphones long, so I’ll do another updated review later, if I remember to!"
"November 17, 2020",Dee,5.0,,"Probably one of the nicest set of earbuds!! Daughter LOVES the sound quality, the design, battery life, and the bass. She's even suggested I buy a pair?! So, I just might do that. Overall, a makes a great gift with a lot of great sound ❤🎧❤"
"January 5, 2021",Michael May,5.0,,"These are so comfortable. Amd, the sound quality is excellent 👍🏾 I love having them hook over the ears. No more worries about having to constantly adjust my earbuds to prevent them from falling out, which often activates a command that I didn't want."
"February 20, 2021",Christina Polizzo,5.0,,Easy to charge. Great sound. Love that I can use one or both and that there are controls on both. Stays in during yoga and exercise!  Great noise cancellation too. Just what I was looking for without breaking the bank!
"January 13, 2021",Ginger L.,5.0,,I love the charging case too! These earbuds are great. The sound quality is wonderful and I had no issues pairing these with both my laptop and my Samsung Galaxy S9. Great little product and customer service is awesome too!
"March 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Returning this because the only problem I had with this earbud is the microphone. Everyone I called complained that my voice was muffled and it was cutting off a lot of my voices. I tested myself by recording in voice memos and they were right. The microphone isn’t built great, not even average."
"May 18, 2021",benlpowell,5.0,,"I bought two of these to keep around for various reasons. They work well, the battery keeps for a long time, and they are comfortable to wear while running. Customer service was honestly fantastic. Somehow one of the earpieces broke free from the base of one of my headphones. I emailed warranty support, they replied immediately (it was near night time US central) and with a picture of it they sent a replacement that arrived in two days."
"December 9, 2020",in FL,5.0,,"WOW! These buds are  amazing; the base sound is fantastic; super easy to set up, had only taken it out of the box and it was already in pairing mode automatically. Walked all over the house (2800 sq. ft.)without losing connectivity."
"May 22, 2021","Victoria's Makeup Secrets, LLC",5.0,,Excellent quality and sound at a reasonable price. I love how beautiful and sleek my earbuds are. The charging and battery life is great as well. It lasts a long time! Noise cancellation is very good with both earbuds used at the same time.
"June 24, 2021",BeanTownBaer,5.0,,Great seller with g communication and support. I would buy these again. I'm still waiting for these to drop below 50% battery life so I can recharge them. What I am saying is the battery life is extraordinary. I have
"October 5, 2020",Happy Wife 214,5.0,,"I really like that the base charges with usb-c so i do not have to tote another cable around. The battery life is very goodz and I like that you can just use one side, either infact, when the situation is appropriate.  They are comfortable to wear and I like the over the ear design so I do not have to worry about them falling out during physical activity.  Sound quality is comparable to other styles. Overall for the price I am very satisfied and would recommend them."
"May 3, 2021",Tommy,5.0,,"Fantastic earhooks with great sound! Very loud like I want them. Very clear and crisp. Outstanding performance, great battery life, and connects very quickly. You can't go wrong with these."
"June 8, 2021",Shakia,4.0,,So I’ve had these for about 6 months or so. I love the headphones my only issue is the charging case!!! If we leave the headphones in the case for a day without any use when we go to take them out they are completely dead!!! Now we just thought that’s how the case was until he had to buy a new pair since he lost a headphone. He had his for about 3 weeks and only had to charge it once! Since I’ve already bought 3 I’m not gonna waste any more money to try to get a working case like his.
"March 21, 2021",AJR,2.0,,"Was quite excited for these as a gift for my spouse. Unfortunately, after maybe 10 hours of use the battery indicator LED stopped working on the case, and only another 5-10 hours of use later the headphones cant even connect to a device anymore. Its a neat form factor, and I wanted to enjoy this as a gift, but it just turned out to be mostly garbage that holds on long enough to fool you into thinking you get a solid product."
"January 30, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"These buds are great for the cost.  They fit perfectly, which is always an issue for me.  The sound is crisp and clear, nice bass, and noise cancelling while in use.  I can wear them and not have my hearing obscured because they are light weight and comfortable."
"March 5, 2021",Eric De Terville,5.0,,"Next day delivery?! Gotta love that. I order 2 of these earbud sets lasta week. My wife ordered a pair and recieved them the next day. I borrowed them since my headphones needed charging. After 20 minutes I ordered a pair for myself. Fast charging, portable and well made. Nice sound quality and louder than the average earbud. 5 stars"
"April 3, 2021",Christopher S.,5.0,,"These are a bargain. Great sound, very comfortable, stay on extremely well, awesome range. Time will tell about battery life but the first few charging's I got more than a week of talk and listening."
"March 7, 2021",Frank Fitzgeralde,5.0,,The sound quality needs some improvement but for the price it's worth it and you get use to it. The noise cancelation is on point along with the battery life. You can use it for w whole week without having to plug it in.
"January 11, 2021",Seth,5.0,,"A friend of mine bought these and recommended them. I was looking to replace my old Anker BT earbuds so I thought I’d give them a try. I’m impressed so far! They’re not AirPods, but at a fraction of the price they’re a great value. The sound is good and every phone call I’ve made sounded clear on both ends. The fit is very comfortable even for small ears. I really like the digital display in the charging case and it does a superb job of filtering out background noise. They also hold a charge well. Would definitely buy again."
"February 1, 2021",Victoria,5.0,,I am very pleased with the sound quality. Noise cancellation is ok. I am able to hear what’s going on around me which is what I want. The battery life is about 8 hours but the charging container last longer. I have had my earbuds about a week and I am satisfied and have already recommended them to others. The pairing process is very easy and quick.  I love the way the ear buds fit around my ear. They are very comfortable and they stay put. This is the main thing I was looking for.
"October 25, 2020",Heather Dickson,5.0,One,"I was so surprised by the quality of sound in these earbuds. Wow! The sound is so clear, the bass is deep, perfect EQ. Noise cancellation is good on music, haven't tried it on a phone call yet. Lots of little tricks to learn yet but so far very impressed."
"July 8, 2021",AS,5.0,,"These are fantastic headphones. Great for meetings, listening to music, and while exercising. They are comfortable to wear for an extended period of time, and were extremely easy to pair."
"January 16, 2021",Lisa LC,5.0,,"My first pair had trouble charging but still worked. I contactes support and they took care of me. The sound is great, they are sturdy as I put them in purse and pocket and no issues.  Great price too. Would buy again!"
"July 12, 2021",Marissa Sanelli,1.0,,"These were great at first, but in only a couple months I started having problems. The earbud wouldn’t stay down on the charger and thus they wouldn’t charge. I had to use as many as 3 rubber bands every single day to wrap around the earbuds and charger if I wanted them to stay on the charger enough to charge. Then this past week the one earbud totally lost sound. It didn’t die, because the buttons still control the music, but no sound comes out. Now Literally less then 5 months later I am back on the market for new headphones."
"June 21, 2021",Luvs2read,5.0,,I have trouble keeping earbuds in and was looking for something that wraps around my ear.  Not wanting to spend a lot and these fit the bill.  Nice sound and great compact charging case!
"June 7, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Overall this is a good product and makes handsfree calling so much easier. The earbud is low profile in ear and sound quality is good but it has moments it disconnects for a second about every 5 minutes when listening to music or watching YouTube which is pretty annoying. I like the charging system and the charging case display is so helpful and clear and the charging case lasts about a week if using for a couple hours every other day. My biggest compliant is the disconnecting it every 5 minutes or so.
"June 17, 2021",RMB,2.0,,"I initially was very pleased.  Fit well, were comfortable and the sound was sufficient for what I wanted.  Had to send my first pair back because one of the buds stopped charging after about 3 weeks.  Returned those and ordered another pair.  The 2nd pair lasted 2 months before one of the buds stopped charging.  I have a message out to the buyer for remedies."
"January 18, 2021",S. Gomez,5.0,,"Wow, for $40, these earbuds are pretty good. The sound quality is pretty clear, and with the little wings on the back of the earbud, I don’t have to worry about it falling out and losing it. The battery life is also really long, and they charge really quickly"
"April 28, 2021",Ryan Goll,5.0,,"Great sound and pretty decent batter life. The worst part is the connectivity, which is a pain when working out. Anytime I move my phone around only an arms length away, they turn off and turn back on. It's quite annoying and I plan on going with a new brand."
"January 27, 2021",Gamecat,5.0,,"So far they seem pretty good but they have just arrived. Sound is good, people hear me fine. Pairing went well on a pixel 4a. No idea if the battery life is as they say. Anyway for the price they seem pretty good."
"October 12, 2020",Patrick Brinkley,5.0,,They're some nice headphones and plus they tell u how much charged they are and the percentage of the battery for the case Is which is great so you'll know when to charge it instead of waiting to see if it's gonna cut off in the middle of charging to know it needs charging. For the price I'd recommend it
"January 21, 2021",Randi Alejo,5.0,,My husband is so happy with these ear buds I got him for Christmas. He keeps bragging about how long the battery lasts cause mine kind of suck and hr thinks he's funny.. Guess I'll be ordering a pair of these for myself next.
"March 21, 2021",Hannah Clifford,5.0,,"I was not expecting to like these as much as I do! I bought these to test out over-the-ear buds to see if they would help keep them in place. I am beyond satisfied. No earbuds ever stay in my ears, but these ones do for hours without having to adjust them! Noise quality is great and surprisingly have an amazing noise cancelling ability even though they do not claim to be noise cancelling. I clean, workout, and move a lot with these in and have had no issues."
"February 3, 2021",lovlaurel,2.0,,"Fit is great and comfortable, however, the charging case does not work. When they are plugged into the case the display shows the current battery level but they do not begin to charge. Tried plugging it into two different computers as well as a wall charger. Since they were a gift that was bought ahead of time I am outside the window to return them."
"February 20, 2021",R.P.,2.0,One,"The sound and microphone work great, but I can’t make it more than four hours with these on Zoom meetings. They’re battery life was really disappointing. The box will say it’s 70% too, but they’re not. They die quickly after."
"February 23, 2021",tad,5.0,,Just got these and I'm amazed at the quality of sound. I also like that it suctions into your ear AND hooks around the ear (which is a must for me since earbuds that just dangle in your ear don't work well for me).
"May 8, 2021",Kelsey,5.0,,"Only have used once but so far like them much better than wired headphones. No issues with connecting, it was super easy, and charging has been easy as well. Only issue has been that rarely the sound will cut out for a second or two (not a distance problem as I had my device on me while running) but the sound came back right after without me having to do anything so I don't see it as a deal breaker at the moment. Hoping they hold up!"
"December 25, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Sound quality, noise cancellation, and battery life all seem fine so far, no particular problems or qualms. I'm not an audiophile or anything so I'm only using it for listening to videos and some music on Youtube. They seem to stay in my ears even when I move my head around to the music so that's nice. I like the interface, big simple numbers and bars, simple straightforward instructions, etc. Just to note, they have a deal for lifetime warranty for 5 star reviews so that's probably skewing the scores, but on the whole they seem fine enough anyway."
"July 1, 2021",GP Seven,5.0,,I like to listen in one ear only most of the time. It is nice that this item will put the stereo together as a mono output for one ear listening. It is safer to use only one ear in activities.
"April 13, 2021",leo poole,4.0,,Good headphones but the range between the two is really bad. I cannot have a friend use one while I'm using mine. And they are definitely not waterproof but otherwise they excel in everything else!
"December 26, 2020",mistyds88,4.0,,I like these over all. They range is a little short. I have a 625 square foot apartment and they don't quite reach from one end to the other. It reconnects fast. It seems like each head phone Is its own entity which is good.
"February 19, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,One,These are great for teachers in a hybrid schedule where you have kids in the classroom and virtually at the same time. There is zero feedback in the room and the mic is very clear. The battery life is astounding. One of many new technological purchases this year.
"February 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,They're comfortable and my music sound great. The microphone quality is better than my cellphone and was immediately recognized as an improvement by a friend. They look and sound great - no complaints.
"January 2, 2021",JM54,5.0,,"I got these for my mom who isn’t technically savvy, but she caught on to how to use them and really is enjoying them! They are comfortable to wear and the sound quality is great! She can walk all around her house away from her phone and not be disconnected from the Bluetooth."
"June 14, 2021",Ms. T,5.0,,I have tried a few different earbuds and these are by far the best in sound quality and most importantly comfort; they don't fall out of my ears with the hooks. I highly recommend them!
"January 5, 2021",dt,5.0,,Fits easily and securely over ear which I wanted; tried various ear buds and always have trouble keeping in ear. I don’t have to worry about losing one when walking or exercising. Sound quality is acceptable and they do cancel out a lot of outside noise.  Charges quickly. Product is as described
"November 28, 2020",Rosita Bonita,4.0,One,"Buena calidad de sonido, y me siento segura de que no se me van a caer. Y aparte te mandan un rascale como regalo se te ganas otro par igual pero o desepcion esto me llego."
"November 27, 2020",Tia J,5.0,,"If you’re sick and tired of your earbuds falling out every time you bend over or tilt your head and then look no further. These earbuds have a good battery life and sound quality that isn’t compromised after continued use like the 1st gen AirPods. I do love that the charging case has digital battery life display. Each earbud can be used independently (I can’t believe I even have to mention that), they just both need to be paired separately once in the beginning. All in all, for the price, it’s a pretty good deal."
"June 11, 2021",Jory S.,3.0,,"These fit good, are affordably priced and the controls make the most sense compared to alternatives, the only issue I ran into was the volume control buttons stopped working after an hour. I purchased 2 other wireless headsets and just didn't like their setups, so hopefully this pair is a one off issue pair and a replacement set won't have this issue."
"September 22, 2020",Jim,5.0,,Had these for a couple of workouts now and appreciate that they don't shake loose like others I've tried. I'm also really appreciating the power level readouts for both the case and for each earphone. Makes it easy to confirm the earphones are secure and charging when placed in the case.
"January 27, 2021",Mmmchcl8,3.0,,"Nice to not be tethered to my computer or phone. Just got them today. Good fit. Easy to sync. We'll see how they work out. Update: 2/16/2021 I like the fit and the sound is good when using with phone but horrible when using with computer. After various attempts at using them during zoom calls, others on the call report lots of static.  A little disappointed but still good quality overall."
"March 1, 2021",Josh Ortega,4.0,,Great product! Comfy great sound and bass. Love the auto connect feature when taking them out of the charging case. I wear them at work and use only one at a time sometimes. Battery sometimes last all 12 hours depending on what I’m using them for. I really like the incoming voice call feature to. Most sets you won’t even know when your getting a call or txt. Only reason I didn’t give them a five star rating is the case feels like it may break if dropped but understand if it was a better case the cost would go up so I am more than happy with it.
"June 9, 2021",Michelle Gonzales,5.0,,"Sound quality was great and the pieces stay comfortably in my ears even while running on the treadmill. When you follow the directions when you receive the item, the bluetooth connection is immediate. What Im working on is hooking it up to my laptop, but right now, it does it job being compatible and convenient to use with my smartphone."
"April 27, 2021",Jennifer Bennett,1.0,2,These are junk!!! Don’t buy!!! First time using them they keep cutting in and out! Sound quality isn’t great either!! My wal Mart cheap-o’s work better!
"July 15, 2021",Vincent Grisell,3.0,,"Several problems.  These headphones don't work with a smart watch.  They don't stay tethered to the watch and one another so constantly cutout.  Also, when in the  case, they don't maintain good contact with the charging contacts so they turn on intermittently.  If my phone is near the case/earbuds they then pair with my phone, so I cannot hear alerts or calls from my phone.  Finally, I've had people tell me the sound quality isn't great when I use them for phone calls."
"July 14, 2021",Christina C.,2.0,One,"Can't hear people when talking no matter what size eat piece you try, you have to cover it with your hands to hear most people even with volume all the way up. It does stay in your ear very secure but doesn't matter if you can't hear and people can barely hear you, you have to talk loud."
"February 19, 2021",Gloria,4.0,,"Other than the level of bass/sound quality- these are by far the best I've purchased as of yet... I am constantly listening to something,  be it iheary radio, YouTube podcasts, Gaia, or movie streaming so I'm constantly replacing earbuds/headsets ( I already lost one of this pair) so I've been through about 10-15 different sets. I wish these were louder but they're great for hands free use for calls and such.. The battery quality is probably the BEST PART of these and they actually stay in my ears!"
"April 1, 2021",Bob Charles,5.0,,"So far So Good, We just received these and they work.  I'm in the Radio Business on Pyramid One World Radio Network and Real Sound is something we depend on..  We just began trying them and I'll tell you if they work as they should via a Computer Connection"
"March 15, 2021",Joyce Smith,5.0,,Super sound quality for the price and long-lasting battery. Came with various-sized ear buds and they paired quickly. Love the over-the-ear feature to keep them from falling out when I’m moving.
"January 16, 2021",Chuck,5.0,,these are the best wireless ear buds that have great sound and bass plus making calls never have to worry about falling out of ear with the over the ear hooks to hold them in place plus the c-type cord and charging display show the percentage that is left
"June 25, 2021",Amanda Nygard,2.0,,"Liked the overview comfort, sound, and charge length but did not like the cheap quality of the carrying case or the fact that it stopped charging and needed to be smacked to align something inside"
"December 26, 2020",Anthony Milan,5.0,One,"Update: The company reached out and refunded me for changing this review to a five star Basically what it says in the headline. When they're working, they work very well. Often though, one or both of them start cutting in and out and it sounds like the audio is bouncing back and forth on either side of my head."
"April 8, 2021",Oscar Hernandez,2.0,,Not durable at all. Took them off after a workout and one of them just split in half. I'm highly disappointed because they have great sound and good Bluetooth distance. $40 down the drain!
"June 14, 2021",HollyT,1.0,,"The volume is very difficult to use on the actual earbud and the earbuds will randomly disconnect from the phone while in close range. In addition, after approximately 4 months of purchase the earbuds will not stay in the charger unless I add a hair tie to hold them down."
"February 9, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,Stay away! First pair didn't charge and case broke right away. Replacement pair won't charge and I don't see any way to return them. They do sound good while they work.
"March 19, 2021",maddox,5.0,,"Great earbuds so far. Most other earbuds come with a SINGLE touch-control button that is awkward to operate, flaky, and overloaded with numerous functions that are hard to remember and interfere with each other. With these earbuds, however, there are multiple buttons to control functionality, which is way more user-friendly and ergonomic."
"June 24, 2021",Shauna,5.0,,"I purchased these headphones because my old ones did not work well when running. The sound kept going in and out. Also they didn’t stay charged for an hour. When I saw these read about the features, read the reviews and saw the great price I decided to purchase them. They work wonderful! The sound is great, They hold a charge for longer than hour and they are very comfortable! I would definitely recommend them to anyone who likes to wear headphones when working out."
"March 25, 2021",ACR,4.0,,"So glad I chose these over the Bose or Beats, which I think are overpriced for what you get. I exercise with them all the time and they're easy to use and charge, made with quality materials."
"May 19, 2021",Jessica britt,2.0,One,"I love the way they feel, they r so comfortable. I use them more for my phone, & taking calls. I hear perfectly on my end, The sound quality on the other end is Horrible. I'm told it sounds like I'm in a tin can.  Wish sound was better, I could wear these all day without making my ear hurt."
"June 27, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,Product came packaged well. Charged ear buds and they rock. Plenty of quality sound with good bass. Im happy with them they may actually sound better than my Bose buds. They fit nicely in the ears and are comfortable.
"March 23, 2021",Sarah,2.0,,"I’ve used these headphones for two, hour long walks and during both walks, the headphones have cut out multiple times. I’m on flat land and not running, so there is no reason for them to cut out. They aren’t the most comfortable headphones either. Skip these and spend the money on quality ones."
"June 19, 2021",petvet,4.0,,Great for listening while being active or not wanting to be tied to a device. Works great during zoom meetings when I’m sitting still but isn’t good for talking while walking- the sound quality shifts in and out due to movement. Excellent battery life and love the charging case!
"May 28, 2021",Ang,3.0,,I had such high hopes for these. I really liked the fit and sound. But I guess it only has a 3 month life expectancy. I purchased them in February and as you can see in the video the left stopped charging. It stopped working right at the beginning of my work out. Back to the drawing board
"November 9, 2020",Kindle Customer,5.0,,"PROs: sound quality, connect automatically to phone bluetooth, loop to wrap around ear; long battery life; auto recharge when stored in case; digital screen shows battery life remaining; storage case. CON: not 100% noise cancelling"
"December 18, 2020",Kaylynn,5.0,,So excited for my new earphones! I bought these as a back up for me and my husband when our battery died. The quality is really great compared to my old earbuds. Love that you can use both ears as the main one/control too
"November 29, 2020",Eddie G,5.0,,I honestly can't find any fault with this earphone it's one of the best I've had in ages feels so comfortable almost like there's nothing on my ears the paert that goes over the ears is super soft and stretchy so it doesnt feel like youre forcing anything to fit your ear in  there are different size tips to ensure every user can get the size tips that will make it suitable for their ears..... trust me I am amazed that it was true to the description... I used mine everywhere the battery life is super amazing the comfort is awesome I would order again not to mention the price
"June 6, 2021",Chris Blazuk,1.0,,"Purchased based on reviews.  Initially very happy with earbuds.  This lasted 3 months.  Right earbud started to fade in and out and a day later stopped working completely.  Went through all available troubleshooting and fixes and no result.  Left still works well enough.  Based on reviews, I'm guessing it was just bad luck to receive a faulty earbud. Not confident enough with the product to buy same again."
"May 23, 2021",Becca P-TX,5.0,,Yassssss.  Finally.  I love them. Easy to use. Amazing sound. Can’t hear my kids complaining AT ALL. I can clean and work out in peace with out offspring voice interference.
"December 25, 2020",Justin Constable,4.0,,These are great.  Work really well. Last for a long time.  I use them every day for work and they are comfortable and don’t hurt the ears when they are in for a long time.  The only small thing is the case lid isn’t held on that great.  The charging part works great but I dropped the case the first day I had it and the lid popped off.  It still clips in but I have to be gentle with it.  Other than that small thing I love them.  Also you don’t need the lid to charge so that’s good.  When answering the phone everyone can hear me great too.
"May 4, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,One,Will not keep charge. After warranty expired I have been having battery issues and have to charge the base and headset every night after less than 3 hours of use.  I want to love this and was about to buy another for my flight to Florida for vacation.
"January 8, 2021",Tiffani,5.0,,"Great product at a great value.  Connects quickly and easily, sound quality fits the price, no audio lag while watching videos on my device, comfortable, I like the buttons on the ear pieces which eliminates accidental commands on a touch-version, nice packaging. All in all, very satisfied."
"June 4, 2021",James Buchanan,5.0,,"I've had these for about 2 months, and I've only had to charge it once! Battery life is great, super easy to use. I've only had a slight interruption in music once or twice, and it might have been from outside factors.  Otherwise they fit my ears great, case is durable and looks great. 100% would reccoment."
"February 14, 2021",Stu,5.0,,These are great. I use them for the gym. The battery life is better than advertised. Very comfortable and I have resisted getting IPods for both the price and comfort. Very happy with this purchase.charging cord is very short however and the case is sleek looking. Sound quality is terrific. Great item
"June 24, 2021",Ken Tyson,5.0,,What I like about my new wireless earbuds is how comfortable it is on my ear and the sound coming out. It was easy to pair the device with my phone and the sound coming out was very good. It has the deep bass sound and not the tinging sound you get from ear buds. I will refer this to my friends and family!
"December 1, 2020",Prime Member,5.0,,Wonderful wireless headphones for the price! They look very nice and are easy to use. They also came will a scratch off for a free gift! What a fun surprise. I personally like a little more bass but the sound quality is great and they are noise cancelling as well! Great headphones for the gym. No problems falling out of ear. *UPDATE* over the last few days the Bass quality has become a lot better!
"January 26, 2021",RVgirl,5.0,,"I love these earbuds!! I wasn’t sure, at first, because I couldn’t figure out how to pair them together....operator error 🤣 Customer service rocks and now I am enjoying these to the fullest! I can answer my phone, listen to music...all on the go. Very happy with them!"
"July 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"These ear buds do not automatically pair with my phone,  when removed from the case. I have to pair them with all my devices, each time I remove them from the case, which is super annoying. I should not have to perform a new pair EVERY SINGLE  time. It's so frustrating, because overall, they're pretty good, cobsidering the price. I haven't even had these for a month and I'm seriously considering sending them back. I'm truly annoyed! I've never experienced anything like this before."
"October 28, 2020",Sami,5.0,,"Super excited about the new headphones. I work in an office where everyone tends to have some sort of headphones. I prefer to leave one ear open to notice important conversations or just friendliness/respect. These are perfect, not only can you use one at a time instead of both, but you can swap them out to charge. So many great features. Super excited to continue using these and all the great features!"
"November 6, 2020",Barbara,5.0,,I have small ear canals and most earbuds tend to fall out. I like these earbuds because they fit snugly in my ears and have a loop that goes over my ear to insure the buds will not fall off and get lost. Quite pleased with my purchase.
"March 31, 2021",whatsittoya,1.0,One,"I am not a huge music buff or anything but it is a requirement to have a good set of headphones when i workout. This was the first pair of bluetooth headphones i ever tried to workout with and i loved them! However, nearly three months later my right ear piece no longer works and that is why i am rating them as a one star overall."
"May 10, 2021",C Me Praise Him,5.0,,"I am very happy with these waterproof ear buds! I ordered them for my elliptical workout, so I needed the ear hook so they would stay on even during sweating. The ear buds do stay on and are comfortable!!! They sound great - love the base!!! They also last quite a while!"
"May 13, 2021",War Vice,5.0,,"Great bluetooth headsets, and for the price. I love the battery level and charging display, and the hooks over ear makes me feel secure, and that they won't ever fall off."
"December 4, 2020",Nikki,5.0,,"Came fast and well packed. Sounds pretty good, very comfortable, it's just the right size, fits perfectly and doesn't fall off. You can easily do gymnastics with this earbuds. Easy connection with Bluetooth, and easy to manage. It is sweatproof, but not completely waterproof, so beware. Battery life I think it's normal, 8 hours. Plus You can recharge them a couple of times with the case. Also, case feels a little heavy, but nothing bothersome. Noise cancellation it's not perfect, but pretty close to complete noise cancellation. For me this are perfect, I'm loving it."
"March 20, 2021",HikerChic,5.0,,"Received as a birthday gift and I am loving the earbuds. Great sound, comfortable in ears and look great. They were very easy to pair with my Samsung Galaxy 21 ultra and also my kindle."
"April 10, 2021",Mehmet C.,5.0,One,"Perfect headphones, so glad I bought it, forgot my charger and went on vacation, charge lasted throughout my 6 day vacation!!!!"
"March 1, 2021",Nancy,5.0,,"I bought the earbuds, as my others kept falling out of my ears.  With the clip that goes behind ear, I have no problems with these at all.  They stay in ear and have quality sound.  Would buy again."
"January 1, 2021",Katie,5.0,,After recently losing my air pods I have purchased 2 different types of wireless earbuds and they just don't compare.  3rd times a charm in this case because this brand has great sound when listening to music. I have not tried to use with laptop but look forward to testing them out in my next meeting!
"July 2, 2021",JESSY,1.0,One,I've used my headphones a total of two weeks and already the right headphone is not working correctly
"May 13, 2021",gabrielle,3.0,,Have only used them a few days and the battery life is awesome ;  I used them for 3 days at 8 hours a day and  are just now charging them.  Other than that they are average.
"January 6, 2021",Christina Lynn Smith,5.0,,"These sync really easily and have a low profile. Light on my ears and they don't hurt. I can sleep with them on! Great for walking, running, comfortable long-time wearing, and I wear them while cleaning."
"October 19, 2020",Eastpt,5.0,,These earbuds synced right out of the box and were very easy to pair to my device. The sound quality is very good and I found these to be superior to the Beats  buds that I had prior. And the price was a fraction of what I paid before.
"October 15, 2020",Megan Breazeale,4.0,One,Great earbuds the charger pack definitely is a great addition for battery life just wish it had more Bluetooth range
"June 14, 2021",J. Campanella,1.0,,"Bought in January, as of late May the right bud no longer charges. Worked well while they lasted, not expensive but 6 months of use a few times a week is just unacceptable"
"October 2, 2020",THam,5.0,,"I like these Occiam Bluetooth Headphones because they stayed in place during my hard core HIIT sessions, weight training, and advanced yoga. They never once fell out of my ears although I had small ear lobes. The sound quality has been great and I have had no issues with the connection or pairing with my iPhone. The charging case has been working well and the battery of the headphones lasted through my 2-hour work out sessions. With the headphones being water resistant, they have been holding up although I sweated a lot during my work out."
"October 21, 2020",Jason,5.0,,"If you are looking for quality wireless headphones for a great price, you found them.  I have had these for a few days now and I have nothing but great things to say about them so far. They are very comfortable to wear for hours at a time. They come with the medium size earbud tip installed but a pair of small and large tips are in the box. Small is little more comfortable for me, glad to have that option. Pairing and operation is easy enough for anyone to figure out. Sound quality for both music and voice calls are fantastic for the price. I would definitely purchase these again."
"May 24, 2021",deb,5.0,,Sound is not what I expected but its acceptable.  Wasn't really sure how to sync them.  Like the behind ear connection.  Soft and lightweight which is my main reason for purchasing.
"December 18, 2020",Laurie Hanley,5.0,,"Came ready to use.  Really good sound, easy to use buttons and they stay put. Yes. You can use them individually! I have not tried them making a call yet. Noise canceling was not something high priority to me; this is medium.  You can hear some of whats going on around you; which I want."
"January 22, 2021",Honest Review,5.0,,Really good set of headphones. Can play either the left or right if needed. Doesn't hurt the ears after being in for a long time. About 6 to 8 hour battery life. Excellent sound and bass. Great noise canceling.
"March 28, 2021",ewald,5.0,,the ear phones are the best that I have bought . they work just the way they were described .with my bad hearing it is hard to find earphones that I can hear and understand the sounds and voice. These are the best that I have found
"December 17, 2020",Donald B.,5.0,,"These are amazing! Pairs quickly and sounds great, the controls are easy to use, and most importantly they stay in place comfortably for hours. i love the idea that both ears can be used alone or together."
"March 28, 2021",BrickHead,5.0,,I have only used them for two bicycle rides of a few hours each. They worked very well and are easy to use. The sound was good enough for the audiobooks and the battery seems strong.
"May 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Nice and easy to use. I am really enjoying the wireless earbuds. I am not obstructed by the wire connecting the two buds as my previous pair. It has a great distance all around my apartment and even outdoors and in the car. It's never fallen off or even loosened on my ear. It stays on perfect.
"January 12, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,There are great. I've only had them for a couple days but I've been using them constantly while cleaning and doing things around the house. I love that you have the option to only wear one at a time so I can keep an ear out for my two little ones. They connect pretty much automatically to my phone once I've taken them out of the case. The battery life it great too. I've worn one or the other all day without any problems with the battery running low. They are super comfortable and secure on my ears.
"January 9, 2021",Shibu Bhavanam,5.0,,"Beautiful and sleek,they are very comfortable with a bendable rubber piece that wraps around the ear.So far, so good. Customer service is really a great value and will buy more products with this brand."
"July 3, 2021",Yas Y,5.0,,Same quality and more compact than the previous model.  It was unfortunate that i lost an ear piece to the previous model but I found this model and like it very much.
"March 5, 2021",Asil,3.0,,What I like about these ear buds is they stay over my ear when I workout and run. What I dislike is you can hear outside of them. They don’t cancel out noise. I dislike how they cut off and on. One ear bud will stay on they other one will turn off and so on. Battery life is good but I can only say that really the only thing.
"December 10, 2020",DESF,5.0,,"This was a great impulse buy. It took a couple of try’s for Bluetooth to synch to my iPhone.  Sounds great, the charging storage is compact and innovative.  Unfortunately the lid easily broke from the hinge."
"April 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"i really wanted to love these, but there are two major problems with them. one is that they just don’t fit tight on my ears. they fall out when i’m running, and there’s no chance for any kind of jumping. two is that they’re definitely not sweat proof. they stopped charging after a couple of months because one of the three little charging dots became water damaged (and i live in dry weather and have never warn them underwater)."
"May 21, 2021",Nancy,5.0,,Great for the price. I only got them today but so far so good. I have really small ears so ear buds won't stay and just pop out. So I really needed something to hook around my ear. Very comfortable
"January 3, 2021",60637,2.0,,These work with my phone fine however I bought them for my computer for online teaching.  I can't get the volume to respond on the computer or the headphone buttons.  The mic barely pics up my voice.
"March 24, 2021",Wanda,5.0,,I love these earpiece so much that I had ordered a second pair for myself. And I had ordered so many othe brands but these are the best that I ever had.I highly recommend 👌 .
"April 24, 2021",jim123483,5.0,,I don't even know how many headsets I have had over the years but these are hands down the best ones yet. I am only a few days in with them but they are pretty awesome. Very happy!
"December 11, 2020",Netero,4.0,,"Headphone case's battery discharges too quickly, and can only be charged with certain USBC chargers (tested around 4-6 around the house only one worked) While it's not the perfect headphone, it's certainly worth th asking price of about 35$"
"November 4, 2020",PBennett,5.0,,I use it for work and  I love it cause I only use i ear at a time  and when its low battery I can put it on the charger and switch it with the other ear bud  I think that is so awesome so iam never with out my music
"March 19, 2021",MBD,5.0,,"I was really surprised by the excellent sound quality of the earbuds. This far exceeded my expectations for the price. However, I did have a stroke of bad luck and encountered a problem with one of the buds, but the customer support went above and beyond to rectify the problem. They were within their right to dismiss my claim, but instead they acted very honorably. This kind of support is priceless, and I will always give my good graces to a company that treats customers this way :)"
"May 17, 2021",James Wood,5.0,,"I have had these for about six months. They work great and have great sound for phone calls and music. Depending on what I am using them for, the battery life is anywhere from a full day to two or three days. Really easy to pair and has a fairly good distance with it too from the connected device. I use it with my Samsung Galaxy S21+."
"April 24, 2021",Gabriel Solis,3.0,,"Honestly, can’t really complain about this product. You do get what you pay for. Sound quality isn’t the greatest and at times the sound will abruptly stop and restart after a few seconds. But for $40, you really can’t go wrong. Had two separate pair of Beats wireless headphones and each experienced the same issue; they stopped charging. Although the Beats have, by far, a superior sound quality, durable, they were not. Compare this $40 price tag to the $200 for Beats, I’ll definitely choose this product over Beats any day."
"June 12, 2021",N J,1.0,,"After a few months I could not hear anything on the headphone From the incoming phone call , you cannot increase the valium  it is on maximum looks like this is not a piece you have to spend money on it unless they could bring improvement in it it is not worth it even for a dollar , I wish I could get my money back to return it thank you"
"September 25, 2020",loneredwolf,5.0,,"I have bought a different pair before these, and I really enjoy the fit better and do not hurt my ears. The quality of the calls is excellent, and the music fantastic. I sue these while working out and audiobooks for school. I like the digital indicator on how much battery life is as well."
"January 4, 2021",Charles K. Summers,5.0,,I have small ear canals. The wrap around ear holders work very well for me -- one of the few solutions that I have in the area of earbuds. The sound quality is good and clear. They are a good value.
"December 2, 2020",aland,5.0,,"These earbud are exactly what I was looking for to use with my android phone. They fit over your ear and are very comfortable. I had bought several pairs before these that were too big or I could not get them to set up with my phone . These fit great,connected to my phone easily, and the battery life is unreal.  They sound great and everyone hears me well."
"February 11, 2021",Marie Tillett,2.0,,I bought these for my fiancé and The only good thing is the battery life. You can hear everything in his background and that causes me to not be able to hear him. Then when he’s home he has to Court off the tv in order for me to fully hear him.
"May 11, 2021",Sarah,5.0,,I just love these earphones.  The sound is great and they connected easily to my Android Phone.  I'm now enjoying a lot of Audiobooks while recovering from surgery!
"June 22, 2021",William D Thomas,5.0,,I am in my ear buds all day. I need the hooks because of what I do. I like the clarity of the sound. I look forward to a long time in these.
"December 1, 2020",Meg,5.0,,"I haven’t gotten to fully test the battery life as I just got them yesterday and the charging case is doing it’s job, but the sound quality is good and the noise cancellation works enough that I can’t hear myself singing along haha."
"October 27, 2020",VICTOR F. NWAOKOBIA,5.0,,"For the price i paid for this Bluetooth earpiece it has been great. Sound quality is amazing nd noise cancellation is good also, i stay long on the phone so my battery tends to die faster but so far its been great for me. i like it,"
"January 2, 2021",Kie Kie,5.0,,These suck the life of these suck if you sweat just a little they stop working! I have had 3 pair! Bought 1st pair the right one didnt work they sent a replacement that right one didn't work then the company sent me a free pair and the right one once again stopped working! They need to put more work on the right ear piece!
"June 16, 2021",Mom of four,5.0,,These earbuds are great for working out! These ear hooks allow me to stay focused on the workout instead of fiddling around with other earbuds without hooks all day.
"May 5, 2021",Michelle,5.0,,Bought them to listen to my school lectures because all the reviews talked about great sound for such a reason price. So glad I purchased them. The sound quality is great whether it’s my read or music I’m listening to and the charge really does last along time. I can study hours for several days before having to recharge. I definitely recommend them.
"January 9, 2021",Amanda Owens,5.0,,I bought these to use in the office. So far I love them. They stay connected VIA bluetooth and has great sound quality. I recommend these if you're looking for a cheap price with great quality. They look way more expensive than you would think. I love them.
"July 1, 2021",Renee Caratozzolo,5.0,,I have tried multiple ear buds and these are the best. We have purchased 4 pairs as a family (I accidentally lost a pair). They fit well and don't move from your ear once they are in. Comfortable to wear all day and great sound. The price point was really great too. Don't hesitate to buy them :)
"July 5, 2021",GCGordon,1.0,,"They stopped working, less then a week after I got them. I can't honestly rate the features, because they didn't work long enough to make an honest determination!"
"February 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Worked great right out of the box.  They fit into the ear a little differently than others I've owned by feel nice after you put them on.  They hooked up to my phone in under a minute.  Good value.
"December 31, 2020",Jada A.,2.0,,"I’m pretty disappointed in these earbuds. I like my earphones to be loud and have bass and these don’t give me that. I do like the little charger but it doesn’t take long for that or that earbuds to run out of battery. Only had them for a month or so and the left is already broken, I didn’t do anything for it to stop working so this was a no for me. Will not be purchasing again."
"March 26, 2021",Richard F.,5.0,,"These earbuds have great sound quality and I really like the over-the-ear hooks that keep them in place.  I will say that when I had a battery issue and contacted Occiam  customer service via email, I received a response within 4 hours!  After a couple more emails, Occiam solved the problem by shipping me a replacement pair of earbuds at no cost to me and gave me a lifetime warranty - all in less than 24 hours after I contacted them!  Excellent customer service!  I highly recommend dealing with this company!"
"January 7, 2021",Vette,1.0,,"These things were worthless I had the first pair replaced after 2 days because when I talk on phone the person could not hear me , so I request an replacement I received the 2 nd pair and they wouldn't connect to my phone ."
"November 28, 2020",DLM,5.0,,"I like that the case displays the remaining battery life. Also, paired easily with my phone. Feels secure on my ears, and comfortable to wear; glad other sizes of ear pieces were included so I could get the right fit."
"November 18, 2020",Steve,5.0,,"Gotta say i was skeptical at first for the price but these headphones get the job done! I honestly didn't find fault in the noise cancelation so the overall sound quality was pretty good and had some decent bass to them as well. I use them on my long workouts and they lasted a good 4 days with the case before the first charge, plus I really like the power/battery meter and the build quality is actually pretty decent for the cost. Im satisfied with them and if it came down to it i'd definitely get another pair!"
"April 30, 2021",Bujji,2.0,One,Not working well. Easily slips from the ear.
"November 27, 2020",Elanfx,5.0,,These earbuds work well. After a couple of months we had a problem getting a good bluetooth connection. Notified Acclaim and they replied with some suggestion and ultimately replaced with a new set of earbuds.
"July 5, 2021",K. Yeiter,4.0,,I like these because they stay on my ears.  There is not a lot of bass but I can deal with that for a 45 minute walk.  Good for the money.  Stay charged for a long time.
"April 3, 2021",michael brooks,5.0,,Look for the price these are amazing. The noise canceling isn't so great but the sound is. Great bass n nice fit. Updated: these things broke in 2 weeks time don't buy
"November 4, 2020",ASC,5.0,,Great pair of wireless headphones and the price was perfect. Just wanted something I could use at work. Very good sound. Very good noise cancellation. Very easy to use. Overall very pleased with this product.
"December 2, 2020",Miss Linda,5.0,,"I now have a set for my husband & I, a spare, in case they are discontinued, and a set I washed. I think they dried out, I'll have to see if they still work. I know they power on. I'd highly recommend."
"May 17, 2021",DIVYOLUZ,5.0,,Great product .Volume DOES NOT WORK Comfy and reasonable sound Sound its not great neither max volume  still not best for loud outdoors or gym privacy
"June 25, 2021",Oaktownchick,5.0,,"I love these headphones. They fit in my ear with no issues, set up was easy, and I can see if and when the headphone case needs charging. If you need a good part of Bluetooth headphones buy these."
"February 1, 2021",Jill Nicol,5.0,,"love these headphones, fits great on ear and wont fall off, great sound and talk, great base, alot of headphones i have tried have hardly any base and fall off at times. These are deffinently worth the money!"
"March 5, 2021",Justin D. Cofer,5.0,,I was very impressed with these buds and I did have an issue with them a few months after I purchased them. The customer service was great and they really want you to be happy.
"December 29, 2020",Rudy Garza,3.0,One,Playing music and battery life is great!!! But when it comes to the phone call......better switch back to hand held so the person you are talking to can hear you. You can hear the person excellent but your caller will barely or hardly hear you cause of muffling/wind sound(That's even indoors or no wind around). This is why I give it a 3 star rating.
"December 10, 2020",Bob G,5.0,,"The easiest Bluetooth headphones I've ever owned. Paired effortlessly and perfectly. Update June 19, 2021 After 6 months I had a minor issue and their support helped me take care of it right away!"
"October 8, 2020",Annie,5.0,,"I'm very happy I went with this, it fits in ny ear and can multitask alot better vs old school wires trying to untangle them and airports falling out my ear. I love the secure feeling that it wraps around my ear."
"June 4, 2021",Kindle Customer,1.0,One,"Hi hopes base on reviews. The buds worked great, sounded great, until they didn't. Less than 3 months and the vufs won't hold a charge. Case is at 100%, buds keep repeating ""10% charge"". You Get what you pay for I guess."
"December 30, 2020",Elena,3.0,,"I find the sound quality to be really grating at anything more than half volume. In comparison, I think the sound quality of Apple's older wire earbuds are much better. The earbuds cut off from the device or disconnect from each other (creating an echoed delay) during usage sometimes. Also, you cannot connect the earbuds to more than one device at a time unlike others."
"June 14, 2021",Christiana,5.0,,"They're a little big on the outside, but the earpiece fits smaller ear canals. which is what I wanted. something that was hard to lose but comfortable for my teenage daughter. Just received. We'll see if they last..."
"May 14, 2021",Scott Davis,5.0,,Sound quality excellent for the price. Bought two pairs one for myself one for my wife and do far we love them. Excellent sound quality and so far the batteries and up as advertised.
"May 21, 2021",Patricia Muhlbach,1.0,One,Only worked for 2 1/2 months just long enough to miss the return window.  One ear buds stopped working and wouldn't charge waste of money
"February 9, 2021",SZ,5.0,,"Have had it for a week so for that period of time it has definitely been a good purchase.  Sound is good, comfort is good and has a good life time on a charge.  If it continues this good I would purchase these for family  members."
"May 27, 2021",juanita,5.0,,"The sound coming from the buds are great as if I have my big headphones on which is a plus, love that they actually sit perfectly in my ears, love the case with battery indicator, great product"
"June 2, 2021",DerekM,5.0,,"Love these Ear Buds, Had a more expensive brand and these by far out perform my old ones.  Glad I left my expensive  ones in a hotel room and I got Occiam!"
"February 1, 2021",Doug,1.0,One,"I can't use Apple's product as they don't fit and fall out....But the pods had nice sound...These fit but sound is terrible...Waste of time and money to buy, sell and return junk..."
"November 16, 2020",Francisco sanchez,5.0,,"Easy controls, comfortable fit minimalist design even though product may appear too large. Battery life can be extended while playing music at 1/4 volume, great  while wearing glasses and sunglasses. The only thumbs down I will give this product is the ability to recharge individual earbuds at least twice fully to get you through your day without recharging case ( that's on personal life experience on which my days are average at 14-16 hours) over all is something that is not a deal breaker for me. 👍🏾"
"April 25, 2021",Mark,5.0,,"I've been using over ear or on ear headphones for years. I thought I'd give these a try. Extremely happy with them! They sound great although, I do use an equalizer."
"December 23, 2020",Julie G.,5.0,,"I have tried many wireless ear buds and either returned them or gave them to my husband because I couldn’t keep them in my ears.  So far, these ear buds have been the best I’ve tried.  I did a workout in them and stayed in without any wiggling, plus they were comfortable.  The sound is decent, the case has an easy battery life readout, and they paired quickly and with no problems.  I’ve only had these about a week, but so far, I’m happy with them."
"November 11, 2020",Brian Epstein,5.0,,"I've used a few different brands of headphones, and these are really good.  I like that they come with different size ear tips, because my ear canals are a different size.  The charge indicator in the case is also a great feature."
"March 23, 2021",Ed Brooks,5.0,,The ear buds provide a good sound and are comfortable to wear.  The button controls are functional and easy to reach.  I plan to use the ear buds on a regular basis.
"October 19, 2020",Deb,5.0,,I would buy these again - They were easy to pair with my Amazon tablet and the sound is great.  Battery life is rally good used them for 8 hours and still have 98%.  These are easy to charge and work great.
"October 15, 2020",John,5.0,,These earbuds are awesome. I like how they stay in my ear always have problems with the little earbuds falling out but because these wrapper on your ear they stay in. The sound is awesome great value great quality you’ll be very pleased with them!!!!
"March 25, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Product was shipped fast and recieved next day. I have used during runs and lifting sessions. They are awesome!! They do not move and have great sound quality to where I can have the volume on low and still is louder than Beats or Bose headphones I have had in the past. They also fit and stay put in my ear better than Beats or Bose ear buds I have had in the past. Great product and would highly recommend to anyone looking for earbuds!
"May 26, 2021",Sergey,2.0,,The sound quality is poor. The bass is not heard at all. The connection is unstable if you move a little away from the phone. You cannot connect to another device until you forcefully disconnect the first one. Volume buttons do not work properly. The battery level is not visible while listening. The microphones of earbuds do not reduce background noise. The description is misleading buyers! They do not fit well in the ear and fall out.
"November 23, 2020",Shasta Criss,5.0,,I am very impressed by these ear buds. The battery life is great. The sound quality is great. And I have not had any issues with them disconnecting. I even like that carrying case that doubles as the charging kit.
"December 27, 2020",Pamela Richards,5.0,,"Awesome ear buds that fit my little ears perfectly and stay put. Great sound, too! Voice on calls is clear and crisp and answering a call isn’t a difficult thing to figure out. Love these!"
"May 4, 2021",Mackenzie,5.0,,These have been some of the best earbuds I have ever purchased. I bought extras because I am accident prone and dropped and stepped on one breaking it. But the price is great so I am totally happy to buy more from the brand.
"April 7, 2021",Michael T.,2.0,,"I liked these to start, however I have had them for a 3+ months and am now starting to have connection issues.  I will be on a walk and one or both with randomly disconnect.  There are times where they also get out of sync. I also have had multiple times where I am receiving an inbound call, and I go to answer the phone and my headphones just say ""Incoming call"" over and over and fails to connect and I drop calls.  Can no longer use while working.  These have become too frustating to use."
"April 6, 2021",Fernando,5.0,,"Sound excellent. Very comfortable, the battery last a eternity, for me it’s perfect to go to the gym. For this price it’s excellent product, 100% recommended"
"April 28, 2021",Chris Chandler,5.0,,"I love these! I'm a small person with apparently small ears b/c all other earbuds fall out. With the over-the-ear piece, these stay on and in my ears. Yay! Good sound and long battery life. And I like the price."
"December 26, 2020",Victoria F,5.0,,"I purchased these headphones as a Christmas gift for my husband, he loves them! They are his first “nice” pair of headphones, he says the sound quality is great and he really likes the quality of the noise cancelling feature as well."
"June 15, 2021",Fay wood,5.0,,"They fit great un the ear.  The battery life if these are fantastic!  Great product.  Since i bought mine, my husband, daughter, son inlaw and a friend have bought a set."
"April 26, 2021",Emily,5.0,,These earbuds have had the best fit of any I've tried. I like the ear loops because they keep them on your ears. The apple style ones just don't work for me.
"November 23, 2020",mhaw,5.0,,"Very nice headphones especially for the price. Easy to work, speakers and mic very clear and noise free when connected. I just started using it and battery life thus far has been great. I will update review as i go along."
"February 1, 2021",Jesse R.,4.0,,Lots of bass but a little on the boomy side. Not my best sounding headphone s but not bad. Stays on the ear and is fairly comfortable. This is one of those “for the price” thing.
"June 25, 2021",Deborah,5.0,,"I am really enjoying these earbuds for running! They are my second pair of wireless earbuds, but the batteries last forever, the fit is amazingly comfortable and I don't have to worry about them falling out.  I love the way the read out tells me the battery level and, finally, the noise cancelling is not so great that I can't hear cars or noises around me. I'd buy these again and would highly recommend these as a quality product with great price point."
"January 4, 2021",Jeannie C,5.0,,"Couldn’t be any easier to charge my Apple Watch! Take it from the box and plug one in to a USB, and the other end is the magnetic disc that clings to the back of the watch.  I love it!"
"February 26, 2021",Elijah,5.0,,This is the first set of wireless earbuds that I have bought Because they were always so expensive. I bought these and they sound high quality and have very good fits in both of my ears. They’re also very comfortable to wear for somebody that doesn’t like anything around their ears.
"January 18, 2021",Omar,5.0,,"I was gifted these headphones to use while working. They are very practical, and have a tremendous battery life with clear sound quality. The earphones can be used independent from each other- which is a fantastic benefit since I often use them in situations where I need to be able to still be aware of my surroundings. They aren't perfect, but for the price it is definitely a 5-star buy."
"May 10, 2021",ann arena,5.0,,Love them.  Perfect for what I need them for and  reaallllly hold a charge  Good sound. Almost always only have one in because I’m wearing them in the office and need to keep one ear open.
"January 18, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,First time trying them on right out of the box and I’m impressed. Having them on for the first time I’m quite impressed. Sounds great and easily connected to my iPhone XR. Update: went to the gym today and these sounded really good with the right amount of bass. It stayed firmly on my ears as I was running on the treadmill.
"February 27, 2021",Lindsey Huffman,5.0,,"I haven't got to use these earbuds much yet, but I am blown away by the sound quality just by testing them out when I first received them! I'm excited to have a good pair of earbuds that drown out all other sound around me. I think its great they come with a lifetime warranty as well. Hopefully it is a well made product and I won't have to use the lifetime warranty ever. Thanks occiam!"
"May 7, 2021",aqsa,5.0,,I love these headphones. My first one stopped working in left ear. I reached out the customer support and they are really helpful. They tried to help me reset  these when that didn't work they sent me new heardphone free of charge. I find these head phones and working similar to high end brands. Recommend this product
"March 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"They sound great. Very full sound, lots of bass. Best for me is they stay in my ears. Ear buds tend to fall out. They stay fully charged for as long as I need them to, usually several hours, and they paired easily with my phone. They work great for phone calls too. My only complaint is the inadequate instructions that come with them. They don't mention there are almost invisible clear plastic coverings over the charging contact points on the headphones. Be sure to peel them off or the headphones won't charge."
"March 21, 2021",Christopher Shelor,1.0,,"I purchased my first set and immediately asked for a replacement.  The battery was not charging or keeping a charge. When I received my second set, after about a month the battery pack stopped recharging again!! Do not buy. There is now no way for me to return. If you do buy, make sure you buy insurance. Horrible product and hard to replace after the second time, there will be a second and third need to replace."
"May 24, 2021",Q-Review,5.0,,"Good so far! Easy to pair with phone, sound is good, battery life is as advertised. Used them while working out several times, they were comfortable and stayed in my ear well. I'm a sweaty individual so earbuds falling out and/or not lasting has been an issue. So far these have held up and there's a lifetime warranty if they don't so they get my reccomendation."
"May 27, 2021",Megan,5.0,,I can honestly say that I was skeptical at first. I haven’t had much luck finding the perfect earbuds. I know everyone is different and what works for one may not work for another. BUT I LOVE THESE. Super comfy even though I wear glasses. No issues connecting to my phone. Not the greatest mic for phone conversations but that could be user error?
"December 1, 2020",Jamie Harris,5.0,,One of the best sets of ear buds I've ever owned! I live that way they fit my ears. Normally ear buds hurt my ears after wearing them for a while but these don't bother me at all! The sound quality is also great!! I could hardly hear anything going on around me with the music playing lol
"June 5, 2021",JP,5.0,,Gift for my daughter. She loves them.  Fits well and stays in her ears. She walks and does steps platform in them and she reports they are very good.
"June 23, 2021",Nahom,5.0,,"Great purchase! Light weight, comfortable, great base, super loud, good noice cancellation, Exceptional battery life. Excellent price point."
"July 6, 2021",Historygal777,1.0,,"Had to return this product TWICE because I can only use the small rubber earbud tips. It states it comes with 3 sets, S M L. Both products came with only the M and L size tips. Very frustrating."
"May 11, 2021",Samantha Saunders,3.0,,"The sound is great ... but first the case doesn't show if they are charging (only when pulled to wall for 2 seconds) and I guess that’s why they don’t work for long, mean the batteries die all the time.  Then they connect when I don’t need them to, took a minute to figure out why I couldn’t  hear my phone.  Wanted to like them but it super annoying... most likely will buy something different."
"May 25, 2021",Trish,5.0,,Used these once so far and they are hands down the best wireless over ear headphones I've ever used!  Sound quality is great and stayed in place for my whole workout!
"December 29, 2020",JWTucker,5.0,,"These sound great and stay put. Really good for working out. Great to have freedom of movement without cords, bulky weight, or worrying about them falling out. When I’m on the exercise bike, I can’t  hear my child talking at me at all! Sorry! Can’t hear you! Go ask Mama!"
"February 21, 2021",Shane Spencer,5.0,,5 stars for sure. I love the sound quality. And the display in the case is nice know battery life. As I go few days without charging.. being able to use one then use other when it dies is very nice. The ear weight is light. Other ones have used felt little more heavier. This was pleasant I like the buttons on there. Some may not. I have issues with the non buttons ones over time.
"July 3, 2021",Richard,4.0,,"There is a lot to like about these earbuds, the convenience of charging using the case, good sound quality, easy to connect. On the downside, you can't to a short rewind like I could with my previous set of earbuds, the range could be better, outside with no obstructions it is 20-30ft."
"July 5, 2021",Bunmi Palmer,5.0,,My wife loves these headphones. The sound quality is really good and they do cancel out ambient noise. They fit really well on the ears and are comfortable to wear all day. The battery power on these headphones is great. She is able to use them for the whole day.  She was able to connect them to her desktop and laptop computers without any problems. I am considering getting a set for myself.
"April 2, 2021",Maria,4.0,,Maybe I never new how to activate cancelation of noise but when I was outside could not heard anything... Sound quality is good for the price and battery life excellent also really comfortable to wear..the only thing I did not like is the material quality they look cheap on appearance but over all very good product
"May 6, 2021",Justin,5.0,,"I deliver all day. I've had to use 2 bluetooths per day for 8 hours for a while. I bought these to supplement a pair I broke. These are the best ones I've ever had by a mile. They are loud, they have far and away the best battery. I have listened to them from 7am to 5pm with a full charge. I love them."
"December 5, 2020",Amy Smith,5.0,,"These are so easy to set up and use. Very comfortable and they don’t fall off. Great sound quality for all uses. I love them for music, podcasts, and talking on the phone -even in the car."
"March 1, 2021",Paul,3.0,,"This headset is great for listening to youtube, music, etc.  However, if you're on a call the person at the other end can't hear you.  It'll sound like you're far away or they'll hear every other word."
"January 17, 2021",Jennifer A. Smith,5.0,,"I have only had them a couple days. They are incredibly comfortable and the batteries lasted more than nine hours of continuous use, listening to music and receiving phone calls"
"December 7, 2020",Danny Brown,5.0,,This product was a lot better than I expected for the price. The sound quality is very good and fit is comfortable. No wire going between the two and I can be active without it feeling like it is going to fall off my ears. The battery seems to last a long time.
"July 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"Well I really loved these at first. I only used the left earbud the whole time I used them. I used them for about 3 hrs per day, 5x's per week. Less than 2 month later the left earbud started cutting in and out and finally just quit working. I filled a complaint through the company and they sent me new ones but once again less than 2 months later having the same issue... I'm done ✅. Disappointing because the battery life was amazing, sound was pretty good too. 😟"
"December 24, 2020",Angel C.,5.0,,These are pretty good earbuds especially for the price. They stay in your ears which is a struggle for most of my earbuds. They also block out sound pretty well as I work in a loud environment. The only fault is the charging case is not as great a battery.
"June 30, 2021",JS,4.0,,Fits perfectly! Sound is good and pairing is easy Great buy for the price. It does have charging issues. Don’t know why sometime it won’t charge.
"March 3, 2021",Mahala Blanco,5.0,,"I was looking for a pair of wireless headphones for running, and these are perfect!  They don't move, fit my ears perfect, pairing was simple, great at noise cancelling, and the battery lasts quite awhile.  So glad I purchased these"
"April 12, 2021",Michael Kheluram,5.0,,I use these when I sleep. I tried it and it did not fall out of my ears no matter how many times I moved or rolled over. 10/10 best sports headphones with great drivers that help process high and low sounds.
"December 14, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I don't really know much about headphones, I usually buy the $7 ones. But I keep dropping my phone and my head phones get ripped painfully out of my ears. Bluetooth stops that and these are great for sharing the office with my teacher husband during pandemic times."
"April 10, 2021",Ameen S.,5.0,,"Great value for the money. I was in the market for a new pair of wireless headphones, after losing my AirPods yet again . So I found these and thought I should give it a try. They are awesome the sound is amazing and they don’t fall out while your moving. I used these all the time at the gym. They are well worth your money . Tho my only complaint is the do take a little time to connect to your phone . But other than that they are good. 10/10 would recommend."
"July 14, 2021",vickie,1.0,One,These are garbage. I rarely write reviews but these are horrible. Do not buy if you have small ears. These are not only too big but the ear hook snapped right off the first time I went to put it on. Do not waste your money.
"July 5, 2021",PT,2.0,,"These worked great for about 6 months and connected automatically when you put them on, but now the case is having trouble connecting and I can leave it on the charger all night long and it still says it’s stuck at 0."
"April 7, 2021",Shoshi,2.0,,"Right side died after a month of use. I now only have sound from the left side, and it glitches out every time I raise my arms...which happens a lot during a work out. Spend the extra money and get a better quality pair if you want them to last. I will say that the noise cancellation on them is great, even the broken right side still keeps the noise out."
"January 18, 2021",Kell them all,5.0,,"These earbuds are perfect.  I have small ears and had issues in the past with size of the earbud and them staying in.  This product offers a variety of sizes that fit.  The ear piece side hooks over the ear, not too big or small.  I can still wear my glasses and even my facemask with them on.  Sound quality is great, works with my phone and laptop, highly recommend this product to others."
"March 24, 2021",Don,5.0,,I purchased this for my daughter to use especially for a hands-free option for her cell phone in the car.  She is happy with the noise cancellation feature and the ease of use.
"February 19, 2021",Ofer,5.0,,"So far I've used it once at the gym and it's worked wonderfully. I love the design of the charging case, which tells you both the power levels of the headphones and the power level in the case itself. I may need to switch to smaller earpieces to get better noise cancellation but overall I'm very happy with them."
"April 5, 2021",Dainean,5.0,,"This was exactly what I was looking for in an affordable pair of blue-tooth headphones. Long lasting battery, easy connection, and they stay on my tiny, oddly shaped ears. (They will probably work for your normal ears, too.) The sound quality isn't spectacular, but I wasn't expecting that in a budget model. Note - It did take me some time to figure out what the charging display was actually showing, but you could just read the directions."
"January 8, 2021",G. Ricci,1.0,,"Not only was the charging case dead on arrival, but when I tested out the ear buds the volume button only allowed me to turn down the volume. Couldn't turn it back up on either ear bud. Lame"
"April 17, 2021",Mr. Robinson,4.0,,Very good an inexpensive set of ear buds. The battery life is insane with the case I probably charged twice in a week. The only down side an its not just this earbuds but most is people sometime says they can't hear me. But overall very good product for the money.
"February 22, 2021",Beachkat,5.0,,"These earbuds are so great for my daily walks.  They are so lightweight, I forget to take them out when my music has ended.  The connection to Bluetooth was quick, and the sound quality very fine for my use.  I will also use them for guided meditation for sleep. Thank you!"
"December 1, 2020",Kayla Brauning,5.0,,I have not used the headphones except to try them out. They seem really good. There customer service is amazing! They got back to me so quickly so I would give them a five star simply for there customer service.
"December 4, 2020",Jamie,5.0,,I purchased these headphones because of the advertised battery life and so far they are working great! I especially love the charging case it comes with which is so convenient to use on the go or when traveling. And I like the LED display that tells you how charged it is. It connects to my phone without any issues and tells me when it is connected through the headphones. I love using them while exercising or doing chores around the house.
"June 23, 2021",Ali,1.0,,"Not sure how this item received 4.5 rating from about 21K reviews. I bought it to use for phone calls but I was very disappointed that the mic quality was very poor and the other person on the call kept complaining about not able to hear me and sounded like I was talking on the phone from distance apart. Other than that, the item shape/look is very good and it sticks in ears very well; sound quality is not that good either. Would not recommend to buy."
"June 7, 2021",S. Taylor,4.0,,"Amazing battery life. I found four different Bluetooth earbuds, some that cost much more. These have the longest battery life of any brand on the market!"
"March 20, 2021",Eric Ayars,5.0,,"... They say they'll send me a second pair if I give them a 5-star review. So take this review with a grain of salt, and all other 5-star reviews with equal suspicion! But they do work out of the box, and connect to my iPhone easily. Good fit on my ears, no complaints."
"February 12, 2021",Sara,2.0,,"They have lower volume to other headphones I have, including some old LG that came for free with a old phone. The LG have better music quality than these as well. They are just terrible headphones for $35. The only cool thing about them is the charger case. I really don't understand why there's so many good reviews. Returning it right now."
"February 6, 2021",Justin Gillis,5.0,,"Perfect. Sound quality blocks cancels out all surrounding noise. Charging the device in the case sideways provides accurate charging. I sweat a lot and charging the devices straight down, prevented my previous headphones from prior charging. Also, charging these headphones, the charging case has levels of charges which accurately shows what percentage the headphones are at. I would recommend these headphones to anybody."
"March 5, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Very nice and great value for the price. Sound good. Good fit, comfortable for long wear and snug. Perfect for sports. Best pair of wireless buds purchased, yet."
"October 19, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Very pleased with the comfort and quality of these ear buds. The product arrived with a broken case and I emailed the company as per inclosed warranty info. They contacted me promptly and offered to make it right. Great customer service!
"March 28, 2021",Z. Xu,5.0,,These earbuds are great! Sounds is awesome and stays on my ear very well during workouts/on my run. I enjoy the fact that they can be used individually unlike some of my other headphones. I also like the fact that I've never had an issue connection.
"September 25, 2020",jeffrey rowe,5.0,27,Nothing! Great buy! Easy to sync because it literally syncs itself with minimal help from me. I’m very please with these Occiam Bluetooth Headphones!
"January 27, 2021",AZ JD,5.0,,"I chose these buds because of the over-the-ear clip - I wanted something more comfortable that I didn't have to push into the ear and these are awesome!  Great sound, comfort and battery life!  (And the over-the-ear clip did not interfere with my glasses!)"
"March 15, 2021",SotSak,5.0,,Didn’t expect to be satisfied with $40 earbuds but what a pleasant surprise. Good quality and the case is small enough to fit in your pocket. Very happy and highly recommend.
"February 1, 2021",Holly Rose,5.0,,"I have been having issues with wireless headphones for years, these are the first that I have found to fit well and stay in place. They cancel noise out pretty well but aren't blaring loud to the point of giving me a head ache or causing my ears to ring. I love these for my spin bike to drown out noise around me and just ride."
"November 18, 2020",Stang61,5.0,,Comfortable!! Most comfortable pair I have ever had. Gave a set and gave as a gift. They loved them too. Ordered another pair for my son because I like them so well and he loves them too.
"March 31, 2021",Kurt Jones,5.0,,"Good sound quality overall for the value.  Easy to pair with android phone and quality of calls is good.  I use mine when exercising mostly and they stay in place well.  Case is bigger than airpods but not too big, I have a small hand see the pic."
"May 23, 2021",7202761675,2.0,,"These earbuds are very difficult to turn on and off. Once they are on, they are great for exercising, sound quality is fine for a work out or listening to a book."
"April 26, 2021",Loren,3.0,,Solid case and good snug fit.  Signal range is less than 20 feet.  Some times they fade in and out even when phone is in my pocket.  I have another brand that holds the signal at a steadier rate.  Decent product but not great.
"January 21, 2021",Kelley Dzurik,5.0,,"Came mostly charged. Connected to my phone and laptop pretty easily. Sound is pretty good. I have only been using them for a little while so far, so I will try to remember to update on battery life later on."
"May 3, 2021",RomeoS,5.0,,"Great product.  I love to run with these ear buds - comfy, don’t bounce out of your ear - super comfy.  The sound is really good - great purchase!"
"January 19, 2021",Myling E Sandoval,5.0,,At first I could not figure how to pair them with my TV which is the whole reason I wanted them. But my husband figured it out and now they are awesome. They are so comfortable. I can sleep with them and they are completely noise cancelling. The battery life is awesome. I am really pleased with ear buds and for the price a fabulous deal. I recommend them for everybody.
"September 9, 2020",batay65,5.0,,"So far happy with sound quality and battery life.  Only charged it once since i received them last week.  Comfortable in my ears, and blocks outside noise.  Only issue may be that those on other end may hear your background.  I had to roll windows up and turn my radio off.  But, other than that......so far so good!!!!"
"September 23, 2020",Bob Mcwilliams,5.0,,"Great for my morning runs, allows just enough ambiant noise to allow for cars etc. Perfect light weight and great fit. My podcasts sound better than ever. I love the one ear option for when I go with my daughter we can laugh at the same stories."
"April 6, 2021",BrittsBookClub,5.0,,Love the way these fit and the sound is perfect for them. The support team was fantastic when there was an issue. They resolved it easily and quickly!
"October 15, 2020",Karen Sigg,4.0,,"These are okay, great for the price! I have actual Power Beats and these are a little less quality as far as the actual headphone material and the sound isnt even close but great for the price."
"May 15, 2021",Lazaro perez,5.0,,Unbeatable deal if it seems like it stopped charging just push it in more or remove and reinsert it I love them when properly worn they dont come off ever.
"April 13, 2021",Ted M,5.0,,"I really these earbuds. They stay in my ears, have a power on/off, answer/hang-up, pause, etc. being able to charge the earbuds and the case make it seem like I never run out of charge."
"January 14, 2021",Angela,5.0,,Love these!  They are comfortable to wear all day  AND the battery lasts all day!  Great sound and easy to use.  I have convinced 2 of my coworkers to also purchase them.
"March 29, 2021",Ammar,1.0,,"I really wanted to like this product after dealing with airpods, but unfortunately this isn't great either. Was working fine in the beginning, but I realized that the left earbud would randomly cut off occasionally for a second or so when taking walks. Then, after two months, it completley went out and plays nothing. Looked at other reviews, and it appears this is a common problem with these. Sorry but these are crappy earbuds, the sound + mic aren't all that great either."
"November 12, 2020",DS,5.0,,"I have had a number of bluetooth headphones. I wanted a new set of headphones for working out, that would stay in my ear and provide good sound and battery life. The battery life is ~5 hrs. which is sufficient for working out.  The sound quality is fine.  The bass isnt booming, but they are good for the price. The charging case charges the headphones and I can get ~4 charges before needing to recharge the case. Overall, I am satisfied with these headphones."
"November 18, 2020",Anthony,5.0,,"When I found my previous headphones (Bose) at the bottom of the washing machine I was so upset but it turned out to be a “Happy Accident” The sound quality of my new Occiam’s is awesome, they fit great and never fall off my ear, unlike my previous ones. One of the best features is that you can hear out of both earpieces when on a phone call!!"
"January 11, 2021",E. Wallis,5.0,,"Have not found a dislike to date. I cannot use standard, just stick in your ear, earbuds, as my ear orifice will not hold them in place. I have found these clipping over the ear to be highly effective and the sound quality is excellent."
"May 18, 2021",rebecca Kennedy,1.0,,"These earbuds have been disappointing to say the least.  Usually only one works at a time and the one working cuts out constantly.  If your phone is anywhere away from ear proximity, there is no connection.  I use earbuds so infrequently that the return deadline went and passed before I even realized it.  I wish I could send it back but alas I am stuck with a piece of technology that doesn't work."
"September 30, 2020",Arlene Larios,2.0,,"Edit: I've now had these head phones for 7 months and the left one no longer charges :( I wrote to the company we'll see what they say. Original: This is my first pair of wireless headphones and I am loving them! They stay on great, the sound quality is great, the range from the paired device is good, and battery life seems good. The only issue I initially had was trying to change the size of the ear bud. It was really hard to put the new size on, but I guess maybe that means they won't fall off either :)"
"May 5, 2021",MJ,5.0,,Easy to pair and comfortable. I like the digital battery charging indicator so you know exactly how charged they are. Definitely recommend!
"June 7, 2021",James Mac,5.0,,"Just received. So far great!  Easy pairing!  Will update review after a few weeks of use. I have used for the last 3 days, workin in the field I wish the volume would go a little higher. I have a slight hearing loss so I’m sure there fine for most users!"
"May 31, 2021",BJoyce,1.0,,I purchased these for work as a headset for phone calls. All of my callers complained that my voice sounded muffled. Did not like the fit.
"March 28, 2021",Dee,5.0,,"I received these earbuds and I wasn't expecting much. But I am so pleased with the quality of the earbuds themselves, and the sound quality is awesome!"
"February 3, 2021",Vic Massagila,5.0,,"I love these, earbuds for several reasons: They're comfortable, affordable, and they are of high-quality sound,  a durable feel, and streamline look). One of my favorite things about them is how quick they are to connect/disconnect with my computer and phone. My overall experience is extremely positive! V"
"February 26, 2021",Le Tonya,2.0,,"I do like the casing, the look AMD quality.  The battery life is ridiculous.  I charged it completely put of the box.  It was at 100. I literally used it on and of for about 30 minutes.  It went down to 87.  Then it said the battery was down.  I could not believe this.  I am so tired of buying bluetooths.  I will try this one more time.  If it doesn't work.  I will be returning this product. Thank you!"
"April 20, 2021",Maxine Caldera,3.0,,"I initially loved these head phones but then the case just stopped working. Also, the ear buds no longer automatically  disconnect from your device once placed back in the case. Thankfully the buds still work but it’s just  a matter of time until those die too. I also like to note I’ve only had these earbuds for a couple months... you definitely get what you pay for..."
"April 9, 2021",ash,3.0,,I just bought these to try and replace my other ones I am not thrilled with the sound  if you are looking for deep bass don't get these. If you are looking for a standard sound this is what these are.
"January 3, 2021",Kelly,4.0,,These are great for an inexpensive pair of earbuds. They are lightweight and easy to use. They also fit on your ears firmly because they hook over the back of your ears.
"January 11, 2021",George1914,5.0,,Very good sound quality while paired to my iPhone and watch. Comfortable even with ear covers for winter use. Long battery life and comfortable to using it in my ears.
"May 17, 2021",texan,1.0,,Sound quality too low. Not the best option. Company is pretty ridiculous on how they deal with their customers. Don’t trust the reviews.
"May 13, 2021",Thomas C.,5.0,,"Hoping to have a great experience, thank you!!! Enjoying these earbuds to the fullest, the sound is great. Highly recommend this product."
"February 27, 2021","James H. Busenbark, M.D.",5.0,,"These earbuds are perhaps, pound for pound, the best I have found for the price.  They connect instantly to my cell phone and the music they produce is amazing.  If you need to contact Occiam for any reason, you will find their customer service reps are the best... very knowledgeable and helpful.  I recently worked with Occiam's customer representative Sammi Chen.  With his help, my concerns were handled quickly and professionally.  I will be buying their products in the future."
"July 3, 2021",Mario,5.0,,Almost bought the new Beats that were slightly the same as these pair but decided to buy these first and was so glad I did! Great charge and fit in my ears very well.
"June 15, 2021",L. Harris,4.0,,"Everything's great, but the volume changing is different from normal headphones. I haven't had to recharge the case after the first charge."
"November 14, 2020",lynnsnotes,5.0,,"So comfortable! I have small ears and buds do not fit, I require them to have the over ear security.  Great sounds, easy to replace in the charging case. Compact and safe for travel."
"December 27, 2020",Joshua L. Selle,2.0,,"I really liked these when I first got them.  They are comfortable and the sound is pretty good.  The issue I have is that they cut in and out often.  One earbud or the other will stop for a bit and then come back on.  The other similar issue is that they power off randomly.  While running the other day my right earbud kept cycling between power on and off, really disrupting the experience.  Maybe it's just my pair but they just don't work to my expectations."
"October 10, 2020",David,5.0,,I just received these and they are great.  I always have problems with headphones falling out.  These wrap comfortably around my ear and don't budge.  The sound is great.  You also have the option of using just one or both at the same time!
"June 27, 2021",Raul Hermosillo,2.0,,I purchased these earbuds in pat because the description said they delivered bass.  They do not.  Very disappointed.  The sound is tinny !!!  I have older (Mflame?)that I purchased for < half what these cost that deliver more bass than these.
"January 12, 2021",ArtsyAshlee,5.0,,Superb sound and durable quality! They dont fall off my ears while I'm working out which is why I got these in the first place. The charging bank is super cute and protects the earphones. I love them!
"October 19, 2020",Elly,5.0,,These are a great pair of earbuds.  I have waited years as the hype of bluetooth earbuds came and went. I was satisfied with my 5 year old corded earbuds- until finally I had enough. These were the earbuds I settled on. And it was a great choice! The bass is quite good and the sound cancelling is actually pretty good too. They also stay connected to my laptop as I walk around the house. (Not 100% of the time but usually I get a really good range.) Overall the sound quality is good for the price. Overall 10/10 would recommend.
"March 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I didn’t get any farther than opening the headphone case and noticed it was dirty, smelled, there are finger prints on things. There was also what appeared to be ear wax, hair, and crud all over the headphones themselves. Not putting those in my ears especially during covid times!"
"May 3, 2021",C. Jackson,5.0,,"Just receive these earbuds and the sound is pretty good. Quality of the earbuds and case is good, very lite weight and doesn’t hurt my ears."
"May 19, 2021",DC,4.0,,"Sound is great, but devise feels big on my ear but very light weight  Have just received them so not yet familiar with battery life. It was 99% charged when I got them."
"March 3, 2021",Chiron Dove,1.0,,"i bought because of the eeview ratio but, im certainly disappointed. bass is non existant, the ear clips are ill fitting based on ear chalber design and i can hear the wind bloW incessantly."
"March 6, 2021",Trisha,5.0,,"Great for listening and no cords! Great battery life, small and compact, it has the over ear thing which is comfortable and just makes them more secure."
"March 17, 2021",MBS,3.0,,"I would have given these head phones a better review if I could charge them in an outlet from a table.  The cord is 11 inches so I have to sit them on the floor to plug them in - and, it didn't come with a plug - I have to use an old iPhone plug.  Why make a solid product with such a poor accessory?  It makes no sense."
"May 8, 2021",mike's honest reviews,5.0,,"These were inexpensive and they really hold their own. I use them every day, and they have taken a beating, but still work well. They sync to every device, quickly, and the battery life is good and hasn't diminished in the months I've had them"
"January 22, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Got these for my husband and they work great very nice that you can adjust the music and talking just through the ear piece and not on your phone or device you are listening on.
"April 20, 2021",Amber T,1.0,One,He has had it for about 4 months and the left earbud will NOT work anymore
"May 5, 2021",Jim,5.0,,I just received these earbuds today. A very good value and they sound very good to my 58 year old ears. I am using the ear tips that were installed. I could probably get a better fit with the smaller tips but they proved a bit to fiddly for me. I will attempt another day. Happy so far.
"May 15, 2021",Jay,1.0,,"I'm pissed!! I purchased 2 pair of these and about 1 month later the right ear piece completely stopped working conveniently after it was too late to return them. The only reason I even bought them was because I read the reviews and they were pretty good. From now on I will definitely read more of the negative reviews as well as the positive ones. Listen when I tell you, these earbuds are defective as hell!!"
"July 14, 2021",Faith,5.0,,I love these I can work my whole 12 he shift without having to charge them. They fit in my ears and I have very tiny ears and they are comfortable. I am about to buy a second pair just for a backup.The sound is loud and clear
"November 18, 2020",Bethany Kunesh,3.0,2,"Works as expected Edit: battery in case began to discharge and make high pitch sound. Headphones had high sound quality, good fit and felt like solid build"
"March 10, 2021",Chris Rounds,1.0,One,These are good earbuds but it’s just 3.5 months into owning them and the right earbud stopped working. They do not function properly with just one because if you turn it up enough to hear with just the one it’s damaging to your ear.
"December 3, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I can use one in one ear for many hours until the battery is low. Then, I put it in the box to recharge and put the other in my ear, and it is already connected. Works great!"
"June 15, 2021",Gilbert,5.0,,"You got this for my son that's been bugging me for some wireless over the ear earbuds he says they working good, he loves how easy it works."
"April 8, 2021",Shiryl,4.0,,I bought these for the way its secured to the ear. I just wish I can here the sound better. It might be me to be honest or my phone.
"June 29, 2021",Fiabella Photography,5.0,,We had an issue with connectivity but customer service went above and beyond to help us get the problem rectified. Highly recommend.
"November 22, 2020",kc0347,5.0,,Best headphones I've owned in this price range. They don't get quite the depth of sound as others I've used but these are a fraction of the price. Very good battery life so far and good range. They are also pretty comfortable compared to other wrap around earbuds. Only minor issue I've had so far is the connection seems to cut out for half a second once and a while but not a big deal for me. Solid choice if your looking for some everyday headphones that won't hurt your pockets too much.
"March 16, 2021",Mrtrex,5.0,,Honestly very surprised. Great for riding my bike. Google buds popped out last week so I tried these and honestly they sound as good if not better for much cheaper.
"March 3, 2021",Daron Whisman,3.0,,Use this for my workout and after about two weeks the left one quit working. Now granted it could be because of my workout.  Will stay with my air buds
"February 14, 2021",Blank Blank,2.0,,"They fit comfortably on my ear and the battery life is decent. However, the sound quality is the Worst! Also, the Bluetooth keeps going in and out on these... Returning"
"June 14, 2021",Sudofranz,5.0,,"I purchased these to replace my previous pair and was blown away by how great the sound quality was! My music was a lot more vibrant and my daily runs more enjoyable. The battery life is great, I haven't even hit the limit of how long the earbuds last on a single charge. I've had them for 5 months now and really enjoy them!"
"January 2, 2021",Michelle B,5.0,,"Bought this as a gift for my Hubby - should have gotten one for myself!  Clear directions, easy to pair/set up. Comes with 3 ear tip sizes very comfortable and secure to wear w/o fear of falling out while exercising. Luv the charging case - stores the buds while not in use and keeps fully charged for next use. My Husband said sound quality is great - uses both buds but likes having the option of only wearing one. Definitely would recommend - very happy with the purchase!"
"March 5, 2021",Ethan,5.0,,Sound quality is good for these being completely wireless. Stays on your ear great. Great price. Good battery life. Easy to connect to a device and use.
"October 25, 2020",Martha G. Langlois,5.0,,"So far so good. Sound is great, volume adjustable, comfy and safe over ear. Sound control perfect. Keeps charge a long time. Makes me happy. I’ll keep a watch for continued success."
"November 27, 2020",Augusto,5.0,,My main interest was being able to use headphones for several hours at a time while doing day-to-day activities. I used to have collar headphones but you pull them and hit anywhere. I love that these Western headphones can be used in mono or stereo mode so they don't make it uncomfortable when working or talking to people in my family. they are very comfortable in my ears.
"December 7, 2020",Eyeola,4.0,,the headphone is good in regards to quality and operation.  When I first had them the sound quality was good only issue at this moment sometimes the person on the other line said they get a feedback not quite certain if that happens when the battery life is low but I will continue using and would give an updated feedback later.
"January 4, 2021",Kindle Customer,3.0,One,"Sound is good, but charging seems to be an issue."
"December 1, 2020",Rene B.,5.0,,"These are amazing especially for the price! Unbelievable quality sound, and long battery life. The charge is quick and gets you back in the gym in no time. I especially like the extra ear hole covers, since I need the smaller ones to fit my ears. I highly recommend this product, you won't be disappointed!"
"November 9, 2020",Amanda,5.0,,I got these because my old one broke and these are way better. Great sound and very comfortable to wear. Tested them out at the gym and have no complaints! Would definitely recommend.
"December 6, 2020",shefly23,5.0,,"I replaced another set of bluetooth headphones because  the volume was too low, and there was no volume control. The Occiam Bluetooth Headphones hhave a great sound quality and solid volume"
"January 2, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"fits well and comfortable.  good sound quality.  other earbuds fit well for small child sized ears.  other earbuds would not fit, fell out of ears and were not comfortable.  these fit snug and allow to be worn while active."
"October 12, 2020",Gaye LaCasce,5.0,,"I was looking for comfortable, over the ear fit and a mic for phone calls; noise cancellation was not important to me, because I actually often need to be aware of outside noise. These are incredible comfortable and stable, with LONG battery life. The clarity for phone calls is great. These are exactly what I wanted and needed, and the case is super secure and easy to carry. I thought I'd have to pay twice the price for these - what a find! Thanks, Occiam!"
"March 19, 2021",Kim Rogers,5.0,,"Earbuds are comfortable while I exercise or just driving in the car for hands-free.  Sound is the best I've encountered so far and I've not had anyone saying ""I can't hear you"" anymore. Best I've purchased to-date and for the price - who can beat it!"
"February 14, 2021",DD,2.0,,"Unfortunately, the LED power display for the earbuds is not working even after it has been placed in the fully charged case for two hours.  There is no light to indicate the current charge level for both the right and left earbuds.  I am hoping that activating the Lifetime Warranty will result in a quick replacement with a product that is completely operational and that this problem will be satisfactorily resolved."
"February 7, 2021",Jeffrey A. Kirkpatrick,5.0,,"These earbud have much better sound than I anticipated! The Highs and Mids came through very well using both earbuds, and the Bass was good, have no complaints. These are very good for the price, fit very comfortably on my ears, ( very secure), and the volume controls are easy to use on the buds. (can be controlled by your phone volume button also). Long battery life too. Good Buy!"
"July 9, 2021",Rower,5.0,,I bought these specifically for working in the yard. They provide great sound and STAY PUT without getting in the way. I love them.
"May 26, 2021",Jeff Smith,5.0,,"I've had these for a little over three months - they sound great, stay placed while running, and hold a charge for several hours. Unfortunately, the charger stopped holding a charge after a run. I contacted customer service and they asked for an order number and a few pictures of the situation via email. They quickly replaced the charger and within 3 days I was back with full sound to accompany my jogs."
"April 8, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I am an aerialist, and am in the studio 6 days a week. These babies don't go anywhere. They stay in my ears no matter how hard I'm spinning or if I'm hanging upside down. I am lost in my own world with them on, no matter how loud the other dancers' music is. Added bonus, They're in my ears practically all day (not just at the studio), and I honestly can't remember the last time I charged them. Great price. Great quality. I love them!"
"March 14, 2021",marblemike,1.0,One,I couldn’t turn the volume up high enough so that I could hear it. I’ve recently bought three Bluetooth devices and I have the same problem with all three of them.  I bought the all on Amazon.
"July 15, 2021",Donald Weiss,5.0,,Sound quality is seconds else.noise canceling is great too. battery life is good. .but what's great is they don't irritate behind the ear like a lot of them do
"January 26, 2021",Leigh,1.0,,"They worked fine for a few days then they just stopped working all together. Wasn’t rough on them, kept them safe in the case when not in use. I’m returning them now."
"January 28, 2021",Les H,1.0,,"Worked fine for thirty minutes and started dropping the connection, finally quit completely. Returned for a refund and replaced them with the Tozo-T5 which are working great!"
"February 5, 2021",Rae,2.0,,"I’ve connected these buds to several devices and the volume is very poor. They’re only “useful,” if listening in a quiet environment. Not recommend."
"May 28, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I recently bought these headphones to use when exercising. I find that they are comfortable and stable even if I am doing HIIT cardio workouts with lots of jumping. They also can be used one at a time or in tandem--a useful feature for running outside. I found the support team to be responsive to my concerns. The sound quality is good enough for my purposes, though the ""headset connected"" notifications are a bit jarring."
"January 11, 2021",Shannon Marie Hall,4.0,,The problem with these is when I'm bending down to do laundry they stop working! They just put what ever I'm listening to on pause everytime I reach for a sock or something!
"December 14, 2020",Elliot,5.0,,I usually do not like inner earbuds but these fit VERY comfortably and do not fall out no matter how hard I try. Sound quality is great as well! Lots of base. Also love the settings for changing song/answering calls. You have to actually click the buttons on the earbuds which prevents you from accidentally hanging up on someone or changing the song when you don’t want to. Big fan
"May 28, 2021",bizophecles,2.0,,"The earbuds are just what i needed for working out. The battery life is great, sound quality is good. But the case!  The case broke in under a week. What a joke."
"May 23, 2021",Emma,5.0,,"I was ready for my afternoon walk when my earbuds arrived. I popped them out of the case, put them in my ears and headed for my walk. I just want to listen to my music as I walk and not struggle with getting my earbuds to cooperate. These are perfect. The sound is great and they are so easy to use. I also like the way they fit around my ears. I am  happy with my purchase and definitely recommend them!"
"April 30, 2021",Joann,5.0,,"Straight up 1000% on customer service. No cap. I had a major problem with the right headphone and they went above and beyond to make it right. I use these everyday at work they never hurt my ears and they work great. Sound levels perfect and it lets people know I aint tryn to talk,  Im here to work. Even the phone calls are crispy on both ends incoming and outgoing."
"June 30, 2021",Rebecca Brendle,5.0,,These are my favorite headphones! I've had them for a while now and still use them almost daily. I really have no complaints at all. They are awesome!
"December 28, 2020",Sara R.,5.0,,"Really good earbuds, with impressive sound quality for the price. My earbuds battery life last about 7-8 hours, and case life about 4-5 days depends on how much you use it. Very comfortable on the ears, the only thing I would fix is the hook so that it feels tighter around the ear. All in all, pretty good earbuds. Would recommend."
"January 31, 2021",Anox,5.0,,I love these! Great quality and very comfortable! Left off charger for a while day and night and still showed 100% charge! Case is Sleek and compact too.
"March 12, 2021",K.T.,3.0,,I apparently didn't research these prior to purchasing them. They don't vibrate on an incoming call and you can't switch songs with the buttons
"January 31, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Bought these for my wife for Christmas and she has been very happy with them and has commented regularly how great the sound is and comfortable they are to wear.  Battery life has been good so far but YMMV as with most things like this.  I like the readouts that tell you battery percentage for each side, the charge port is conveniently located on the outside of the rigid case.  Overall, great product for a very reasonable price point!"
"January 12, 2021",Karen,1.0,,"Purchased 9 Jan 21 on 7 Mar 21, Left side stopped working, started by  constantly connecting and disconnecting, followed on line video instructions to no avail. Now it will not power up. Would expect it to last a little bit longer."
"December 26, 2020",James Chamberlain,3.0,2,The battery life on the case is non existing. Amd the head phones is 4 hours at the most. Sound is pretty decent but my issue is the the battery life
"November 26, 2020",kari,2.0,,"Yeah so first off the prize scam they have is just that to get reviews. Second don't try and have a hat, glasses, beanie or anything around your ear as they will get very uncomfortable and sound terrible. Once worn more than a few times they don't sit in the charger case right right which means they will connect/disconnect from my phone all day long even when not using them........."
"March 5, 2021",jean beaulieu,5.0,,"Works very well, real easy to use, self connecting, can use a single, only thing for me It does not fit quite right. but good enough. ""loving it"""
"February 22, 2021",Lan,5.0,,"The earbuds are as described. The sound quality is not as good as beats, but good for calls and streaming from my tablet. I like the fit. I like the charging method. The charging case is smaller and will fit into your pocket"
"February 9, 2021",TOBY S.,5.0,,"I like that they are easy to pair. The sound is clear. I have a hearing issue, I can hear out of them very clearly. The battery lasts a long time before it needs recharging. The case makes it easy for charging the earbuds."
"February 25, 2021",mr.swagwagon,5.0,,I bought these to use when I run. Other earbuds fall out when I run. These do not and they sound fantastic! I am very pleased. Thank you so much.
"June 11, 2021",Lori J. Crowner,5.0,,"Was easy for ordering. It is easy to work. You can still hear stuff going on around you. However, I have no issues with them."
"December 12, 2020",Jarrette Black,4.0,,"The reception will not go too far before cutting in and out, and the bass isn't anything exceptional, but they are decent for playing games, listening to music, or watching a movie! Don't expect to be blown away with these headphones, you'll be disappointed!"
"December 9, 2020",Raed Masri,5.0,,Very affordable and I am enjoying this unit It fits the purpose of my life style when working or long walks\running - takes sometime to get used to since this is my first Bluetooth device for a while maybe 4-5 years so I like the fact that the charging case takes a long time for it to be recharged.  I do believe that one improvement can be made is to design the volume to be little louder for the iPhone but volume works great on Windows 10
"December 16, 2020",Kathleen,5.0,,Customer service was excellent! They responded within 1 day and were very accommodating and polite. The ear buds have excellent noise cancelation. They go around the ears nicely and they come with a cute easy to transport case. The best thing about them is that you can use each headphone on different devices! They each serve as their own controller. Very pleased with the customer service and with the product!
"October 19, 2020",Makayla Miller,5.0,,"I really liked this product. It has good battery life (haven’t had to charge them yet and I’ve been using them for 3 days) and it also had good sound quality. It’s fairly easy to connect one earbud and I often only use one at a time. However, the downside is I haven’t figured out how to connect both a the same time without really focusing. Other than that these are a great deal for the price!"
"December 2, 2020",Rachel L.,5.0,,These headphones are incredible.  The bass tone is just off the chain forizzle. Seriously qont be disappointed buying these.  I'm ordering more as stocking stuffers!
"April 12, 2021",PATRICIA,5.0,,"I am not big on ear phones. But I do like them. Battery last a very long time , probably because no one calls me. I do recommend. I would buy again."
"December 8, 2020",Nia,5.0,,"These earbuds sound really good, they also connect to one another as they should, and they connect to all my devices easily. It is also worth noting that the mic works pretty well."
"May 26, 2021",Charlie Gardner,2.0,,"actually liked these and thought they worked really well for running.  I need hook earphones to stay in my ear.  I'm giving it a low rating because my right headphone won't charge and I'd have to buy a new pair since it's past the return window.  Bought these in November and it seems like products should be built to last, a 1 year exchange would have made my rating much higher."
"February 17, 2021",5bassman,1.0,,"Well, they worked well for a little while. But like most of these they don’t last long. These lasted 5 months. The last two pairs lasted about a month. Now one earphone has no sound. Went through the trouble shooting and did the reset and repairing and still the same. Don’t recommend these."
"March 22, 2021",YoMaMa,5.0,,I use these as Sleep buds. Very comfortable & noise cancellation blocks vibration from my upstairs nucience/neighbor.  Buds battery life holds true for 7/8 hours.
"May 22, 2021",Heatherly42,5.0,,"Great waterproof earbuds! Wish callers could hear me better, but these are so great for working out or walking around the house!"
"February 22, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"OK! So I have had these headphones for about a month now,  and I can say they are pretty decent! I have 2 main issues with these and that is the case, it's slippery  and there is no indicator of which end to open.almost broke them the first day and you have to literally disconnect the ear piece to use it on a different device.  Other than that! I love that they stay put in the ear"
"December 18, 2020",luobobaicai,5.0,,"I bought these as alternative to my Bose ones that I can only wear at home . The sound quality is great and almost similar to my Bose ones.  The batter life is awesome and last more than 8 hours.  The design of the container box is great by having digits showing batter level of the case. Overall,  I am very happy with the performance, the battery life and of course the price. I would recommend my friends buying these. I am going to buy a second pair of these real soon for my son."
"February 3, 2021",Anne Hughes,5.0,,"I am not very technically inclined, so I don't like items that require an engineering degree to get going. I was very pleased how easy the Bluetooth earbuds connected to my MP3 player.  I liked how easy it was to adjust the volume.  I was impressed with how the earbuds fitted and stayed on.  Also the sound was amazing.  I am very pleased with my purchase."
"January 23, 2021",Jennifer L Simons,5.0,,"I'm hard of hearing and these do help.  They are comfortable to wear, easy to pair and love the rechargeable case that has a digital charging display."
"May 3, 2021",Alex,5.0,,Great for listening to music and audiobooks while I work on my car. The don’t fall out of my ears or have a cord to get caught on things.  I really like them.
"June 25, 2021",Jim,1.0,,I do not like the product it keeps turning on and off even with the phone within a few feet it connects and disconnects constantly and when you least expected it turns itself off constantly this product is so bad it almost May quit shopping at Amazon
"January 20, 2021",Tom,5.0,,Great clean crisp sound and a nice deep bass and well worth this low bargain price.  Very confrontable around the ear fit . Best ear buds I have owned .
"June 26, 2021",mark fanelli,3.0,,Poor sound quality. Muffled and dull. Earbud case difficult to get open. Odd configuration right earbud is on the left side of case and the left is on the right side of the case. Though it is something you can get use to. In my ears they fit well. Again the sound quality is the issue.
"April 10, 2021",T. D.,5.0,,"Was looking for good BT ear buds that didnt randomly fall out and these stayput. Sound is pretty good, and for the price, you can’t beat em!"
"March 13, 2021",henser,5.0,,"I highly recommend this set of wireless earbuds, especially if you are real active and you want them to remain on your ear.  Also, the sound and look is great."
"January 2, 2021",Nicholas,5.0,,"So far I've only been able to use them a couple of times. battery life is great, i really enjoy being able to only use one headphone at a time, since i bought them for work. Sound quality is great considering price point, they are buds so they do cancel some noise, but they are listed as a noise cancellation product. Overall ive super satisfied with my purchase as it beats having to spend hundreds on some name brand beats or air pods that give little to no upgrade in quality."
"April 23, 2021",Mark,5.0,,"I bought these to replace another pair that cost a similar amount and these way out perform that pair. Get plenty loud, and block out a lot of sound. Ended up breaking one on accident and contacted the company if there was a replacement part and they said they would just send me a new pair."
"June 22, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,I purchased these in 11/20 and was quite satisfied until last week the charging case suddenly did not work.  I think it no longer makes correct contact with the plug.  The led came on for about a second and then shut off.  Now I cannot even get that to happen. I am not sure how to contact the company for advice as the web site does not give any resource for doing that.
"February 27, 2021",Normal middle-aged guy,1.0,,"They sounded great for about an hour.  I charged them according to the instructions.  I used them 3 times.  They cut off at about the 1 hour mark each time.  It was disappointing, they sounded great during that hour.  Returned them."
"February 10, 2021",Ginny J,5.0,,"I was looking for workout earbuds with a hook, so I won't have to worry about them falling out.  It was important for ease of setting up,  as well as using after set up. It passed with flying colors. The sound was also important, so far I am very impressed, especially for the cost.  I look foward to many hours of music with my new earbuds.  I Love the sound as ease of use.  I can see why the have so many positive reviews, they are fantastic!"
"July 15, 2021",Joseph R.,2.0,One,Sound quality wasn't that good. They weren't really loud and kept cutting off randomly. Only good thing about them was the battery life and the fact they were wireless.
"October 4, 2020",duna walker,5.0,,"Omg, I've had these bluetooth for 2 days!!! I absolutely love them ❤️ Lightweight, sound is absolutely inpecibule, feels like I don't have anything over my ear and I've gone through a lot of bluetooths!  I would definitely recommend this brand.  Price point is on point!"
"November 12, 2020",Natanell Francis Brown,5.0,,I received my headset really quickly. I was a bit sketchy about purchasing a brand I wasn't familiar with but I'm glad I took the chance. The headset fits perfectly which is a big deal for me since I have small ears and I can never find a good fit. The battery life is amazing and it works perfectly well. Once I have my headset in everything else around is almost none existent. It's definitely a 5 stars for me. Worked so well I bought another as a gift
"December 7, 2020",BethCleveland,5.0,,These headphones are so comfortable. They connected easily to my kindle. The sound is clear. My favorite part is I can use one and leave the other in the case. I like to listen with one ear to my book but be able to hear my surroundings. Awesome! I would buy these again.
"September 11, 2020",G Sorge,5.0,,"like the fact that they wrap around the ear, very secure. Also the display in the case/recharger makes it easy to see how much charge is left on the ear buds and charger, my old earbuds told me low, medium and high. I also like that the volume controls are on the ear buds and are real switches, I had a set that used touch control and was hard to use. Pairing was easy and it reconnected on the next power up."
"March 11, 2021",HarryG,5.0,,"Excellent sound quality, wonderful design, and lifetime warranty plus free replacement even if you lose one. More than anyone can hope for!"
"December 16, 2020",vanity68,5.0,,These are great. Sound is clear and there’s no cord which is great. The case charges the ear buds so they are always ready to go. Love these. Worth every penny.
"March 16, 2021",B Berkemer,4.0,,"If you want the case to hold a charge so you can charge your earphones again, don’t leave the earphones inside the case. It will drain the battery’s case. Only put the ear buds in when you need to recharge them."
"February 7, 2021",alfredo,1.0,One,"I really wanted to like these headphones .they sound good and pair up with my phone nicely . But the huge issue is the charging case ! I had one case stop working after two days , amazon replaced it and the second case died after about 40 days . I had thrown out the box so now I'm stuck with bluetooth headphones that can't be charged that are now permanently dead ."
"May 13, 2021",Snake Pisken,3.0,,No way to plug it in  to charge it unless you have a handy PC . Thr ear plugs dont fit unless you have  elephant ears .
"December 13, 2020",Ebony Marie,5.0,,I love these headphones. They are comfortable and the battery life is excellent. The sound is good. For the price I was really surprised at how good they were.
"November 17, 2020",denise,5.0,,"i love it! it sits comfortably in my ears! and the noise cancellation is so good that i cant wear it to work anymore lol im only allowed to put on earbud on one ear and even just on one ear, i cant hear clearly when someone is calling me lol so that should tell you a lot"
"February 26, 2021",V Levy,5.0,,"I just opened the box and right away, I love the fit  and I was concerned that the ear look would be too big. I also love the way you can charge them right from the case. When they are charged, I will be able to give a full review."
"November 15, 2020",Suzi,5.0,,These earbuds are great. Easy to set up and sound quality is very good.  Stay on ear well and very comfortable.  I use at night to listen to audio books.  With these you can use just one earbud. Would highly recommend!
"February 4, 2021",Khalilah Rivers,5.0,,"Clear high-quality sound. Easy connection to Bluetooth device. The volume button is very responsive on earbuds. Nice snug, comfortable fit around and in my ear. Nice accessories inside the box to vary the size of earbud for different size ear canals. Even the case quality is excellent. The buds set securely inside and the lid closes tightly during transport and travel."
"December 8, 2020",M. Thom,5.0,,I've been using the wireless ear phones for only a day but they're great. I really like no wires so they don't get tangled. Sound quality is also really good.
"December 16, 2020",T.W.,1.0,,"The very first day I used these headphones, the sound quality was poor.  The headphones would phase in and out and the sound would not come out equally from the headphones.  The right ear headphone would play before the left ear headphone.  It seemed like the left ear headphone had a lag.  THIS ALL HAPPENED ON THE FIRST DAY OF USING THESE HEADPHONES!"
"July 10, 2021",Ellabeth Del Sarto,1.0,,"They lasted approximate 6 hrs. The box charged but the headphones died and could never be charged again. Troubleshooting manual said wipe off any oil residue if it wouldn't charge, did, box said 100 for box and headphones were charged.. just would never turn on. I gave up and these turned out to be expensive headphones for a 6hr listen. They were too big for my ears anyway. Great sound when they did work."
"March 8, 2021",Dixie,5.0,,"Just received, impressed with the quality and look forward to using this product.  Excellent sound quality!  Like very much getting lifetime warranty too!"
"October 12, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"These over the ear Bluetooth headphones are comfortable.  I use them when walking and doing yardwork around the house.  They sound good,  come with an assortment of ear buds covers, usb cord and the case has a charge level indicator.  If they last, this is a great option for the price point. I am glad I bought them."
"February 6, 2021",Shaun Olinger,1.0,,"Left side died like a wire broke. Skipped and blupped a couple of times, then quit. Putting them in File 13 and find something else."
"May 19, 2021",Chuck Butts,4.0,,At first I really didn’t like them but found out they were on the wrong ears. After correcting my stupidity they sound really good. I’m able to wear them with my motorcycle helmet on and sunglasses on. I’m very pleased with my purchase.
"April 26, 2021",Bvasquez4,5.0,,I was just gonna use these for the gym but they are so good that I am using them everywhere. I love the deep bass along with the compact design. I enjoy that they connect as soon as I pull them out of the case and returnimg them to the case gets them charged up for my next use. I love the sound quality and noise cancelation.
"January 23, 2021",JP12,5.0,,"Just bought these so I can’t comment on battery life although I really hope I do get the 40+ it advertises.  For now, they are very comfortable with good sound quality."
"April 25, 2021",Robin F.,4.0,,Ear buds work great. But this is the second charging cord I’ve had for this product that has broken within 2 Weeks of use!
"October 12, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,At first I was skeptical of getting these ear buds because they were so cheap but after using them for several days they were the best purchase to make. The sound is great its not beats but its 30 dollars what can you expect.  The most important thing to me is the functionality of the product and they function exceptionally well. I was nervous if they would stay in my ears and after working out with them for several days they haven't fallen out and the battery life is excellent.
"May 7, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Haven’t used them yet but they fit nicely, charged easily, paired easily and generally feel like good quality earbuds!"
"November 25, 2020",jerseyMike,5.0,,"These wireless earbuds were easy to use right out of the charging case which is nice and sleek, longer and less bulky than the earbud case my husband uses. Earbuds paired easily and have great sound. I bought these to use at the gym and appreciate the comfortable fit and the fact that they stay in place which is important. Highly recommend, great quality at a great price."
"February 18, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I use this product for workout , I like this product because it fit in my ears great, I don’t worry about it pop out while playing basketball. I work great for me so far. The is clear"
"April 7, 2021",SuzieA80,5.0,,The earbud headphones are always falling out of my ear. I like that these go over your ear for added protection. I love that the battery life of the case and each earbud is displayed. They have a great battery life. I listen to podcasts at work and they last all day if not more.
"June 17, 2021",Alye,5.0,,Very Good sound quality and Great for on the go jobs such for music and handsfree phone speaker.  Perfect for Delivery Drivers.
"February 21, 2021",Jennifer J. O'Reilly,5.0,,Love the feel of these and the information-centric case that charges AND lets me know what the level of battery-charge exists in EACH unit!
"December 17, 2020",Jon cas,5.0,,"I just received my new earbuds yesterday and I have to say I'm impressed, the sound quality is very smooth and I love the display on the charging case! The design is really nice and I'm super glad the case has a C-type plug in for charging since I own a galaxy device. Overall this is a good product for a good price!🙂 I've also had a chance to speak with customer service for warranty and to claim a reward and they are quick to respond and are very helpful!"
"May 15, 2021",Number XV,5.0,,Product came charged. I was surprised about that. Thought I'd have to charge it. Haven't tested them out fully yet but they seem really neat. Little concerning that the company's website tries to bribe you for a 5 star review. I'm hoping it's just a language barrier thing as the main company appears to be outside the US.
"December 24, 2020",Prime Enamel,5.0,,"I really didnt want to spend a ton of money on wireless earbuds I would only use for working out, but man these are perfect, they stay in the ear, last at least 6 hours at max volume, and work great. Im glad I bought these."
"July 6, 2021",J,4.0,,"These earbuds are comfortable to wear and the sounds is good. On occasion there is a drop in sounds, no idea if it buffering or some other issue. The customer service for this product and this company is outstanding! I contacted them for a small issue which they more than adequately helped to resolve. They were quick to respond and very courteous."
"July 15, 2021",Ronald Palmisano,3.0,,Works okay for casual use. Don’t think that you will be using them for your motorcycle or lawn tractor not going to happen. But you get what you pay for and for that they are done.
"December 4, 2020",Jaci,5.0,,These are awesome.  I love having the option to use one ear bud or the other instead of both at the same time. Sound quality is great and battery life is awesome
"February 16, 2021",shotguncharlie90501,5.0,,These are great Bluetooth for doing chores around the house or listening to music in the shower. They charge quickly and last a long time.
"February 19, 2021",Bumblebee Tuna,2.0,,Couldn’t get mine to charge in the case.  The ear flaps push the phone away from the charging contacts... Very light though...
"June 16, 2021",Timothy,1.0,,"I was looking for a good set of truly wireless headphones.  I liked the design they were comfortable... BUT the volume buttons didn't work at all.  Kind of hard to turn up the volume, so I can listen on my motorcycle, if I can't even control the volume from the headphones.  Doubt I will buy any kind of off brand headphones again. In my opinion even though these were cheaper, they weren't worth the price."
"November 5, 2020",Milo,5.0,,"First of all, they sound great . The around the ear piece is very flexible to customize the fit. And finally, the controls are very simple to operate and work easily."
"May 6, 2021",Kara Lewis,2.0,,"They are not bad wireless earbuds. However, I have had horrible headaches and sore ears since I've started using them. I've even been nauseous and dizzy. The volume on the earbuds would not work. I have tried to get them to work by changing the ear covers but no success. Again they are not bad just didn't work for me....volume buttons are not working."
"February 22, 2021",Sean and Rachel Gamble,5.0,,"I was a little worried about how these headphones would function and I am not disappointed. The battery life on them is amazing. It lasts me on average 2-3 days using them for 4-8 hours per day. The sound quality is crisp, clear, and, undistorted. They have great range even with walls in between myself and the phone. I tried to find a negative and could not. These are by far the best Bluetooth earphones I have EVER bought. they are absolutely amazing."
"November 12, 2020",Ariel Elizabeth,5.0,,"These headphones are great so far. Good sound quality and noise cancellation. The only thing I wish is that people could hear me a bit better, but still figuring out this feature. Their customer service has been helpful. Best headphones I have had so far!"
"March 16, 2021",Elena,5.0,,"Occiam Bluetooth Headphones can work till 5 hours, and can be charged in 1 hour till 100% level. Sound is good, noise cancelation is amazing for the price (I used to wear Boss many years ago and can compare). Really great choice."
"February 20, 2021",ANTOINETTE,5.0,,Excellent Quality for the price! I'm really impressed with the sound quality of these buds. The bass is amazing without being too invasive and blurring the audio in your ear so that's a huge plus for me. Luv them!!!!
"May 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,Sound is good not great. Wish it had more bass. For the most part it serves its purpose of staying on when exercising.
"March 25, 2021",B.H.,5.0,,Very comfortable to wear. Only wish volume can be controlled from either earpiece instead of have to push both at the same time.
"July 14, 2021",DogTheMan,5.0,,These headphones are great for working out or just listening to music!!!!! Good sound quality and good durability!!
"May 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Received these as a Christmas gift.  They worked great for about 5 months and then they would no longer pair with one another.  I contacted their customer support and Sammi was fantastic.  He responded to each and every question to confirm the device went bad.  A new one was shipped out within a couple of days no questions asked.  It’s great to see a company that stands behind the warranty and products.
"November 26, 2020",Walnerg,5.0,,"I like to run and do body movement exercises and have had trouble friending wireless headphones that would not fall out of my ear. These headphones have been awesome, they dont come out of my ear while I'm running, and the sound quality is great. I also like that I can tab on the right ear headphone to skip and song or the left to go back and replay."
"March 31, 2021",JHM,5.0,,They have very good sound quality and they have the piece that wraps around your ear to prevent them from falling out during activities.
"February 28, 2021",Sy,1.0,,"A micro-usb cord was sent rather than a usb C, so it does not fit and cannot be charged. Even if the correct usb cord shipped, I would have to do some research as to a power brick that wouldn't flood it with too much electricity, since that is not provided. The user manual riddled with grammar errors doesn't give me much confidence in it either. Returning."
"June 23, 2021",Gary Griggs,5.0,,I have purchased 5 other brands from Amazon and these were the only ones we kept and will buy another set. Very comfortable and secure. I’m a rock n roll enthusiast so this type of earpiece can always be louder (for outdoor athletics) but indoors they are more than sufficient.
"May 9, 2021",Maurice,5.0,,This product is very good for the price bought it for my mom and she loved it also she love the fact that she knows when her ear piece about to die
"April 12, 2021",Travis,5.0,,Fit perfect.  Currently charging them up before using for the first time.  Just wish they had a charging indicator on the case.
"March 21, 2021",M.Reynolds,5.0,,They are wonderful on the ear's. They don't feel uncomfortable like others that I have tried. The battery life is excellent!!! I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase!
"May 2, 2021",Christine Kimsey,4.0,,"I like how the product looks and how easy it is to open the case but I feel the volume was so low that I had to turn my phone's volume all the way up (yes, I did use the volume buttons that were on the earpieces)!"
"December 9, 2020",Michael,5.0,One,"I liked the first set so much I ordered another one. It fits my kid's ears and helps to have this type of hook design. Battery is good, quality materials and sound is great for what you pay for! See my first review for a little more info."
"October 25, 2020",Jerry H,5.0,,Bought this headset due to the hook onto your ears in stead of the strictly in-ear ones. Decent sound quality and battery life for the price. Only thing is that I had another pair where the charging case can be used as a mobie charger for other devices as well (i.e. phone) where this one doesn't
"January 18, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I got these because of the hook, but they hurt so much I couldn't wear them for longer than 5 minutes. I would recommend getting something that is malleable if you don't have big ears. I really wished I liked them, but the plastic in-ear is not doing it for me. I only tried these once and opted to buy some cheap wired earphones instead."
"November 28, 2020",LadyJane,1.0,,***EDIT 4/14***. Won’t charge.  Too bad I liked these but now wouldn’t recommend. Perfect for a run.  Sound quality is excellent!  Nice and light on the ears as well.  Highly recommend over the more expensive brand!
"February 12, 2021",Payton P,2.0,,"this product does not have the claimed 48 hour playtime battery. i am lucky if mine makes it 6 hours. it wont even last through a work day. and the case battery life is equally as bad. i can charge it up to 100 and by the next day, it's back to 0. sound quality is great when it actually is powered on. i would definitely recommend if they fix the battery issue."
"January 1, 2021",GPep,5.0,,So far so good. Great quality and a very good fit. Excellent quality on the case as well. Great choice in my opinion. Definitely good value for the price paid!!
"May 14, 2021",Johan M. Gallo,5.0,,I like the compact unit and headphones fit great. LED tells you charge percent which really helps me. Sound quality is great.
"October 20, 2020",BandaPanda,5.0,,"These are some of the best earbuds I have found.  I switched to the smaller tips and they are super comfortable.  They are very lightweight and so far have worked really well.  They do not pull on your ears at all.  The only thing I have noticed is when someone called me they cut in and out some, but I think that was due to signal not the earbuds."
"January 29, 2021",Kyle K. Andrew,5.0,,"Don't waste any more time.  For working out or enjoying media, there is no comparison I can draw.  I have used JBL, PowerBeats and many more.  These stand out as great quality at a fraction of the price."
"July 10, 2021",Contradictional,3.0,,The headphones don't snap into the correct position to charge. I have to use rubber bands to hold them in place.
"July 5, 2021",Kira Lindsay,3.0,,These fit super loosely because my ears are on the smaller side. Returning them so I can get something more for me.
"February 12, 2021",time consuming,5.0,,These are great fitting. I can get into my zone easily by canceling outside sounds. The battery life is best I've seen and the charging case charges they quickly and have a strong magnet to keep the case locked.
"January 11, 2021",Justi Clemmons,5.0,,"I bought these for my wife as a Christmas present, and I wish I would have bought myself a pair as well. Excellent sound quality, great noise cancellation, and great fit. I love the battery charge read out that is super helpful and a feature I wish I had on previous pairs of headphones. I would definitely recommend these."
"November 18, 2020",David,5.0,,"I intended for these to be a backup pair of headphones. For the money I spent, these are outstanding! I haven't had them long, but so far they are awesome!"
"December 10, 2020",Krystal,2.0,,"They are easy to use and light weight but as a person who gets sweaty they are terrible. They stay in my ear, but the power does not stay on, in fact they go on, off, on, off, uncontrollably. I have even tried wearing a sweat band but it still happens. I also  tried to use them (fully charged) for about 2 hours and they died (perhaps from turning on and off the whole time) so I""m not sure about the 48hour playtime. Liked them at first until I had to use them practically."
"April 17, 2021",Jenny Ward,5.0,,"I have only had them a few days, but so far I really love them. The sound quality is really good and it blocks the back ground noise really well too."
"February 10, 2021",Mark F.,1.0,,"One of the earbuds quit working the first day.  Occiam said I won another pair and that they would send them as soon as I gave the an excellent 5 star rating.  They never replaced the set that wasn't working and, of course, they never sent the pair I ""won"".  They don't stand behind their product.  Fool me once and shame on you, fool me twice and shame on me."
"July 9, 2021",Amanda,5.0,,These are amazing. They actually stay put while running. I’ve had a hard time with standard ear pods or wireless buds staying in my ear but the hook around the ear keeps them in place. The sound quality and battery life are outstanding. Very comfortable to wear. Love these!
"December 11, 2020",Jacqueline,5.0,,"Professional packaging, great design and they stay in place. Earbuds fall out all the time so I was thrilled these stayed in place. Highly recommend."
"May 24, 2021",G3Fam,5.0,,"These are great. sleek - well designed - noise level is great - clear calls and i love that i can pause from the button on each headset. Also, the battery life is great."
"June 29, 2021",Romekia Cox,1.0,,"I am so disappointed. My left ear bud is not working at all, The right side is working great. I am so frustrated"
"March 10, 2021",cassie barry,5.0,,"Love these headphones! They are great at canceling noises, convenient, and have great sound quality. The price is also very affordable!"
"February 18, 2021",mrsh,4.0,,I bought these for myself and I really like them. not only are they comfortable but the battery seems to last a fair amount of time.
"April 13, 2021",D. Grupe,5.0,,Best fitting earbuds ever! Great quality sound & phone audio is clear. Having these makes my workday go much smoother! Thanks!
"December 7, 2020",Waldo,5.0,,"The headphones are pretty well sounding.  I have been using them for a little over a week now while at gym, & no complaints on sound &/or connectivity."
"June 1, 2021",Rhett Bradbury,1.0,,These headphones are low qualitythe right one broke a month after I bought then the left one broke now I only wore one at a time due to work rules.
"July 16, 2021",Neverknow,4.0,,Overall a good product. Noise canceling is not very good. Bass is not best but all other tones are adequate. I like they have never fallen out even leaning over and moving vigorously.  Battery life is awesome! 8 hrs on a charge. Well worth the low price just don't ask them to have best qualities in every category.
"June 28, 2021",rjainapu,5.0,,"Loved the buds! I have had it for a week. It’s light, sound quality is wonderful.  Plan to use it for some time. Also have an AirPod."
"December 21, 2020",Pat,5.0,,Wonderful audio quality with the addition of it being waterproof & fitting nicely in my ears as well as with the guard. I also appreciate the gift & warranty.
"December 28, 2020",Claudia Oltean,5.0,,"I've been using these and am extremely pleased with how they sound, their ease of use and the battery life.  The fit comfortably and I use them daily."
"July 6, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Bought these for myself and I love everything about them!  Sound is very good and they stay securely in place!
"May 3, 2021",Arimose,5.0,,The best sound that I have experienced so far. Great Battery Life!!! Easy connectivity. Awesome Head phones!!!
"October 28, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"Ive bought a lot of bluetooth wireless headphones and these are amazing. Ive found some great one that ive also put at 5 stars but my opinion these are the best. These are low profile compared to others, get just as loud as others ones but these have great sound quality. Love them and highly recommend."
"April 24, 2021",Byron12,5.0,,Great ear buds they fit great and the sound is amazing I was surprised by how long the battery life lasted 5* all day
"April 15, 2021",kimes2036,2.0,,"Left earbud failed after about 5 months.  No sound out of the left, including on/off voice indication.  I'm fairly confident this is not a pairing/connection issue, since I can play/pause using the button on the left (failed) earbud, and the sound of the right earbud responds those to play/pause commands as normal. Even before that, they had a bit of a ""crinkly"" sound when I ever I moved my jaw."
"February 18, 2021",Bobby,5.0,,"Easy to setup. Connects automatically, excellent sound quality. The extra bud sizes included make it easy to customize for true fit"
"January 20, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I just received the earbuds just today. But so far, based on my limited experience, so good. I am looking forward to taking advantage of them to listen to my tv shows, music, movies, etc."
"June 13, 2021",Monaca,5.0,,"First the fit was amazing, then the sound quality was superior because you hear very well, clear. Being able to just use one earbud at a time (if you choose) extends the battery life. Each earbud can receive call, raise lower volume,etc."
"March 30, 2021",Christopher S,1.0,,"The case no longer works for charging and I'm watching as the headphones slowly die... Until this point, I liked these headphones. The sound was fine for the price. The battery life was great – the headphones themselves offered great battery life and with a quick charge in the case, they could go a long time between plug-ins. But now the case is no longer working, rendering the headphones useless once they run out of battery life."
"February 15, 2021",Charles Johnson,4.0,,"These earbuds really came ythrough for me and helped my get through my workouts.  I tried other earbuds (not over the ear) and they just kept falling out and getting shorted out due to the sweat fro my workouts.  These have great sound quality, are sweat resistant, and i don't have to keep trying toi catch them as they fall out of my ear."
"January 10, 2021",GIT IR Done,5.0,,I bought them based on its reviews and I was not disappointed. I enjoy the comfort and the stability on and in the ear as I go bike riding and need that security. The charging case stays charged for more than a few days with non use and charges up fast it needs to be charged.
"January 17, 2021",breanna sharkey,5.0,,Just got my order and so far they connected easily. Did take a minute for the other speaker to kick in which worried me but then was fine.
"December 31, 2020",Rai Bainter,5.0,,I have tried so many different Bluetooth wireless earbuds over the years and this model has the best deep bass  - definitely keeps the energy going when I'm at the gym! It's very lightweight and comfortable once I found the best of the three different sizes of earbuds tips. I also love that either of the two can be the master earbud.. I use one for phone calls on my drive to the gym and the second connects immediately when I put it on for music after arriving.
"April 14, 2021",Rhonda,5.0,,"I purchased these for my husband who works on a golf course.  He uses mowers, etc.  He absolutely love these earbuds."
"May 27, 2021",AO,5.0,,"I throughly enjoy these headphones. They fit so securely behind my ear that I'm not ever worried about them falling out during my jogs or at the gym. The call quality is So smooth and clear. I normally have issues with earbuds call quality being choppy and low.  These are by far the best headphones i have owned all around. Noise cancellation 5, fit 5, easy pairing 5, bass 5. These are THE BEST!!"
"April 16, 2021",stephanie rice,5.0,,Great value for awesome sound and reliability!!  Cant beat the price for these and they hold a charge for a long time
"February 1, 2021",Michael Ballard,5.0,,"Great earbuds, I like the storage case and the sound quality is pretty good. Nice and loud. Seems to hold a solid charge. No issues connecting to my phone either. Pretty happy so far."
"January 19, 2021",scalypurpledragon,4.0,,"I love the design, the noise cancelling buds combined with ear hooks are perfect for vigorous activity. My only complaint is the case cover's hinge broke after a day, and now I must be careful not to lose it."
"November 30, 2020",erin,1.0,2,Sound is very low battery life is horrible
"March 5, 2021",Jennifer Middleton,5.0,,"Seems to work great so far! The main I purchased this set was for the noise reduction and price point, both of which are great. I also like how the charger box shows its battery life and the earbuds themselves also advise how much life is left. Delivery was a day late, but that's not the manufacturers problem and, frankly, sh!t happens. My life went on, the package arrived the next day all is well 😀"
"April 25, 2021",Nanaberries,5.0,,These have an awesome sound. The sound is clear and the bass is bangin’! I love the rechargeable case that they come in too!
"December 3, 2020",L M,5.0,,"Fit my small ears really well,  sound quality for calls & audio is great.  Had it about a month no problems. In-case charging is a convenient feature."
"September 28, 2020",Nakai Marr,5.0,,These are my 8 year old's favorite pair for virtual learning and zoom calls. They don't hurt his years and they stay on when they do jumping jacks/dancing in class.
"May 17, 2021",Barry Shelofsky,5.0,One,"I needed to request a new pair of wireless earbuds as there was an issue with the charging unit. The customer service representative, Sammi, sent me a new pair of wireless earbuds. They work perfectly!  The product is a winner."
"March 10, 2021",Stew,5.0,,Give it five stars now because way about expectations. Charging now but batteries came with a lot of juice. It’s a gift for wife’s birthday but may buy one for myself. Sounds good easy set at a great price. I’ll update and after my wife continue to use.
"March 6, 2021",Nicholas,5.0,,"The headphones themselves are great, theyve lasted me 12hours continous play and still not.  The charging case only lasts a couple days before you have to charge it but still is good also. Great wuailty comfortable but very little actual noise cancellation."
"February 11, 2021",Christine D.,5.0,,"These fit well, they are lightweight and comfortable. Just what I was looking for. Sound is good with both music and call quality."
"February 9, 2021",Tara Langworthy,5.0,,"A gift for my 24 y/o son.  He loves them! Comfortable, great sound, secure fit, long battery life.  For over a year I searched for a good product I could afford, this came through in spades."
"December 30, 2020",Ryan Dix,5.0,,"Great noise cancellation and sound quality. The case is super high tech also. About to go on my first run, so I’ll follow up with how they stay in!"
"February 17, 2021",Eileen,5.0,,Best purchase ever....love these earbuds .. three different ear tips included... used the smallest tips due my small ear canals.. all other products fell out of my ears due to them being too large...these fit my ears perfect ... great purchase!!!!
"March 6, 2021",Steve Cross,5.0,,They are awesome.  They stay hooked over the ear just like I needed Customer service is awesome... very proactive on confirming I received my orders and all is working well. Thx u guys
"January 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Sound quality is outstanding (very clear) & perfect fit on my ears. The charging case display well designed. Really like the ability to see the power display & the display for each earbud. Also having the option of using 1 or both earbuds is great can always have one charging when using the other. Highly recommend.
"March 11, 2021",Robert Hernandez,5.0,,These are nice true wireless earbud. They sound good. I work with loud equipment so noise cancelation is important. Not the best for noise cancelation but it will block out a good amount. Battery life is great. 8 hours each before I switch out or 8 hours for both. I recommend this for a low budget wireless sound.
"June 21, 2021",Jessica Cook,1.0,,"Horrible product. I've had them for 3 months and the left ear bud will not connect anymore. I've never dropped them or accidentally washed them. The right one works but the left won't at all. I've gone through all the troubleshooting steps and nothing. Amazon can't help because it's past the ""window"" for them. Waiting to see if the company will replace them or atleast refund my money and take the product back."
"December 22, 2020",swassociates,5.0,,"Great value. I'm very impressed with the comfortable fit. Easy to use with nice accessible controls. Nice charging case, very good sound. 5 stars!"
"November 18, 2020",Breanna Lockman,5.0,,I have finally found earbuds that fit in my narrow ear canals and don't slip out while running and sweating. Having a portable charger is even better.
"June 21, 2021",M. Zachari,5.0,,These earbuds are super comfortable and super stable! I like the sound and would definitely recommend them!
"June 11, 2021",Jacob,4.0,,"First shipping by amazon was amazing got my order much earlier than expect. As for the ear buds they feel a bit fragile and i would not expect them to last if i actually used them when going to the gym, and currently the right ear has trouble reconnecting to the left unless I place them in the portable charger after use. However they are comfortable, have great battery life, and good sound quality."
"May 29, 2021",W. Chase,1.0,,Everything was...ok...the buds fit poorly in charging case. Then the one side just fully stopped charging
"February 15, 2021",CWatty23,3.0,,"I have average size ears and these headphones were wayyy too big! It doesn’t even wrap around the top of the ear so they are not very sturdy on the ear. I like the hard touch buttons but since they don’t sit well, using the buttons causes the ear bud to shift out of place. It can be very annoying. Otherwise, they have decent sound quality and the battery life has proven to be good through the first week of having them."
"May 14, 2021",Gerald E. Wheeler,5.0,,I just got the set.  I will be using them for phone cons for meetings.  Time will tell whether these are really a wise buy.
"January 4, 2021",Timothy,5.0,,"All around the product WAS better than I expected, but after 2 weeks the left side stopped working and I've sent numerous emails to the seller and no reply. It's been over a month and no word.  Also I supposedly won a free pair of headphones that I have not received a confirmation email or anything else about as well. So as of now, it's a waist of money and time... if they contact me, I'll change the review."
"February 1, 2021",Kelleena Guzman,5.0,,I ordered these for my husband to use at work and they were ready to go! They have optional ear size adjustments for the in ear cushion and easily fit around the ears. The sound quality is amazing and you do not feel like they are going to fall off.
"April 22, 2021",Innovataion,5.0,,"This is a great ear buds with excellent battery life. I have Air pods which are dying out, this is a replacement for exercise only."
"March 27, 2021",William McIver,5.0,,Musically it’s very sweet Vocally it’s crystal clear Battery life I can’t ask for better Comfortable to the ear🛵
"May 3, 2021",Ryan,5.0,,Not a bad product for the price! They stay in place for most activities so I would give them a second buy for that alone.
"May 16, 2021",NADER TADROS,2.0,,"The received sound quality was superb. Very crisp and clear. The problem is with the microphone. Those receiving my calls reported that my voice was too low and muzzled. Since my old mon has a hearing problem, having a powerful microphone is very important to me. Hadd to return."
"March 18, 2021",C.V,5.0,,"The quality is awesome. And I like that you can control the volume (up & down) with either one, unlike others that you can only turn the volume up with left ear and volume down with the right ear. Also it is more convenient than the fancy touch sensitive earbuds because you don't have to worry about hanging up everytime you adjust them while in use. Definitely a good buy!"
"February 5, 2021",Annette Wingate,4.0,,"Just bought these but so far so good. Sound is clear, long lasting charge, for me anyway. Nice charge case. I love them so far!!"
"December 15, 2020",Linda B.,5.0,,"I am loving these earbuds. They are comfortable and easy to operate. Love the buttons on there where I actually know that I am pushing the right area on the buds for volume and calls! And bending , jumping  and walking they are not budging! Love them!"
"April 28, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,One,When your on a call people can't hear you clearly. They've said I sound far away or very low voice. But music sounds very clear.
"January 13, 2021",Silver Watchman,5.0,,"The sound quality is Crystal clear, the noise cancelation is great for phone calls and sofar the battery life is great, I have been using for the better part of the day with no problems. Now the only thing is that you need a type C to recharge the case."
"November 25, 2020",Killingsworth,5.0,,So when I bought these headphone I bought them for work. I use one at a time and love that one ear piece at will last me though most of my shift and that they fit nice and snug in my ear. And if you sweat at work it doesn't damage the products sound quality. I also like the fact that it has noise cancelling ear piece. For the price of the head phones it's a great product
"March 4, 2021",K. Merveldt,5.0,,"These are comfortable. The hook helps since I have small ear canals. Sound is good, battery life is good, and easy setup."
"December 26, 2020",janet galla,5.0,,"These are fantastic.  Bought them for my husband, who has tinnitus.  They are soft and fit him comfortable to lie in bed and listen to music and no wires in the way."
"May 19, 2021",BevJ,5.0,,I love these earbuds so far.  I have had to buy two in the last six months and  the other companies did not replace.  The sound is great and I recommended this to my friend and she loves it also.  Love that it has sound for a very long time and lets you know that you have an incoming call.  It also has a great range away from the phone.
"January 9, 2021",AC,3.0,,Update: cable got frazzled in one month; my replacements don’t fit for some reason. Never had cables frazzle so quick. Now it is junk.
"February 16, 2021",Adam S.,3.0,,So far so good!  Battery lasted all work day! Update:  one of the ear pieces randomly shuts off and starts up again.  Gets old!  Now batteries life cycle is dramatically shorter.  I use them almost daily for several hours though.
"January 11, 2021",JAIA,5.0,,"I needed earbuds that had the hook that goes around the ear. These fit great and feel very secure and so light that it doesn't feel like I'm wearing them. I haven't had a chance to use them a lot so far, but the phone call I made appeared to be clear and with no issues. I love having  actual buttons to push for functions and the volume right on the earbud!"
"December 20, 2020",boots baby,5.0,,Loved the fit it is really comfortable. It is great that you can see the power level in the charging case. Like them better than more expensive brands. Spar earpieces to customize fit is a definite plus.
"May 17, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Easy instructions and ready to use right out of the box. Easy pairing and good sound quality and volume.
"December 30, 2020",Andrew Warner,1.0,7,"Didn't even have them for one day. The headphones would strictly only connect to my phones Bluetooth calling capabilities and not the overall media of the phone. The case is nice and pretty but the headphones sounded terrible. I didn't get to hear much due to me not being able to actually connect to the media on my phone but the ""connected"" and ""disconnected"" tones I heard in the earbuds sounded awful."
"February 17, 2021",C,1.0,,"Right ear lost connection after 10 minutes. Then the right ear would just keep repeating “power on, power on, power on...” The only reason this has good reviews is because the company sends a discount code for 5 star reviews. Very misleading. Returned and bought a more reliable set: JLab sport earbuds. Costs more but no hassle.  Been 3 weeks with no issues."
"June 20, 2021",J. Donovan,2.0,,I thought these in March and loved them at first. About a month ago the right one stopped charging and now it appears the left one isn’t charging either. I’ve tried just the charging box as well as plugging the whole thing in. They also often disconnected and reconnected several times through one workout.
"January 3, 2021",Xiohara,1.0,One,"Horrible. Though it paired easily enough, on three different devices the right earbud kept disconnecting from the left, causing the volume to drop out continuously. Impossible to listen to anything. I'll be sending these back, as they don't work as intended."
"December 31, 2020",denver88,5.0,,"If you are looking for blue tooth earphones with a comfortable and good ear clip this is the product, the bluetooth connection is very easy and charging system is very good"
"January 14, 2021",Beatty,5.0,,I like the headphones! They have good sound quality and wireless with no cord. They fit great on my ears! I don't think they will fall off. Battery life is great!
"May 9, 2021",DrProactive Randy Gilbert,5.0,,These Occiam earbuds are super comfortable and clear sounding. I wear them almost everyday... all day.
"December 21, 2020",Amazon Customer,3.0,One,"The sound quality is pretty good and they are comfortable. They never feel like they are about to fall out of my ears. However, they go in and out of sync frequently with each other and with my phone. They also disconnect and reconnect with my phone often."
"January 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Just received these headphones (they came quickly) and setup was simple and effective.  They sound great and no problems connecting to my phone.  The charging case is convenient and a good way to store the headphones safely.
"February 20, 2021",Keyia L. Matthews,5.0,,These are freaking awesome! They are loud & great quality and they keep a good charge. So worth the price! Love love love them
"December 31, 2020",Trust the Process,5.0,,I purchased these b/c the other earbuds I have fall out of my ears. These have the hook so it keeps them secure and I love the charging case. Great headphones!
"February 26, 2021",C Noto,5.0,,Love them. Best ear plugs/head phones I own and stay put instead of constantly falling out. Stays charged for long time.
"May 27, 2021",Wade,1.0,,"These are really good....until they stop working which is inevitably very soon after purchase. I have had 2 pairs now, the first pair was replaced by the manufacturer because the charging case wouldn't take a charge therefore it wouldn't charge the ear pieces. Then the second set worked great and then the left one stopped taking a charge. So save your headaches and get something else."
"December 19, 2020",Nae’ Thompson,5.0,,"I just got the buds yesterday, but I love the ease of connectivity that's big for me while driving, etc. The case is sleek and the buds are lightweight and easy to use that too is important to me. The noise cancellation is the only space that's questionable for me... as my dogs snore and I can still hear them while wearing the earbuds, but that's cool I guess."
"June 10, 2021",Jessica,5.0,,"Battery life, sound quality and appearance all better than expected!!! Very happy with these. Worth the few bucks."
"January 4, 2021",H.R. Hofmeister,5.0,One,Needed wireless that wrapped around the ear and provided clear sound for audiobooks. These fit the Bill.
"November 4, 2020",Tommy Hines,5.0,,"These earbuds paired up quickly and easily with my Android phone.  I purchased these based on previous reviews and because they had the extra piece that holds them in your ear.  My previous set of $150 earbuds were constantly falling out of my ears when working or exercising.  These stay in place nicely.  You can get better sound quality with higher priced buds, but the sound quality achieved at this lower price point makes these a great buy IMO."
"February 21, 2021",nancyro,5.0,,I just tried these and they fit without feeling like there is anything behind the ear.  I like that they are secure and sound great.
"April 11, 2021",Ward S,5.0,,"I am pleased that they fit. As I mentioned in the headline, they don't feel like they are going to fall out. It has been frustrating for me to have to keep putting my earbuds back in my ears. I don't think that will be a problem any longer. The sound quality and balance are good. I listened to instrumental music (organ), singing, and spoken word. All were clear; the quality seems quite good for earbuds."
"March 21, 2021",Ara89,5.0,,The Sound Quality is Great. I like that I can use just one and leave the other in the box. One click to answer. One click to end. Double click to ignore the call.
"February 25, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,"Love these.  For the price, excellent buy. I had a problem with the first set and the company immediately sent me a new set."
"December 26, 2020",kmac,1.0,,"The first time we were charging it, it started smelling badly like something was burning. It made the whole area of the house smell and luckily we were able to figure out that this is what was causing it before it started a fire or something."
"December 22, 2020",jacksprat,5.0,,Excellent product.  Charges quickly and excellent battery life.  The sound quality is crystal clear.  Fits quite comfortable. Noise cancellation is also great.  Am very pleased with this purchase
"June 26, 2021",betty,4.0,,I loved these ear buds. 4 stars because they only lasted 3 months or so. I just ordered another pair because I liked them so much and they have good reviews.
"April 19, 2021",Ben Johnson,5.0,,"This is an awesome product, especially for the price. The sound quality, noise cancelation and clarity is great. I use them for jogging and hardly notice them."
"June 10, 2021",J. Vaughn,5.0,,Quick n easy.  A nice bribe of a lifetime warranty and a free pair of earphones with a full bar score. No wonder there were so many perfect scores.
"February 22, 2021",courtney colliver,5.0,,So far they are nice quality for the money. They slide in and out of the case nicely and having the digits display of battery life is nice. My ears are smaller and I have a hard time finding ones that fit my ears without falling out. Having these go over your ears help them stay on.
"May 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,Poor sound quality. The music sounds like it's coming out of a large bucket. Muffled with no highs.
"June 9, 2021",Jason S.,1.0,,"Worked fine for about 10 uses. After that they would perpetually connect and disconnect making the earbuds unusable. Tried unpairing/re-pairing them with no success. Maybe I bought a dud, but they're not worth the hassle to return so I guess it is what it is.  Seems like Amazon carries a lot of unvetted junk these days.  Lesson learned."
"January 5, 2021",Robin Raffey,3.0,One,Not what I expected
"April 14, 2021",KT,1.0,One,"Wasn't expecting all that much from this.  Was just hoping to listen to podcasts on a daily dog walk.  Have used it maybe 15 times and it does not work.  Says that it is fully charged, but I can get nothing from the ear buds.  Total waste of money!"
"May 13, 2021",Lauren,2.0,,"These headphones were great...until they weren't.  The sound quality was fantastic and I loved how the charging case would show there power level of the earbuds.  Now six months after purchasing and using them, the charging case will no longer charge, therefore leaving them unusable.  This was very disappointing, but I guess for the price I paid ($36.88), I should not be surprised."
"January 6, 2021",David B,5.0,,"They are very good quality earbuds. I bought them for my wife as a Christmas gift. She really enjoys the sound quality. For the price, these earbuds are very good!"
"February 17, 2021",Malyssa Collins,5.0,,"Purchase this for my husband and he loves it. Ease of use, with crystal clear sound, noise cancellation and comfy in his ears. Doesn’t get better than that."
"May 12, 2021",Claire Thibodaux,5.0,,"Comfortable fit; love how the case shows you the battery level digitally. Grey sound. Not a fan of the noise level of the “on/off”indicator. Even when I turned the volume down, this volume stayed the same."
"February 21, 2021",Mat,4.0,,"Nice set for gym .. rubber ear buds fall off easily tho , case lid broke , charge cable very low end , overall they work"
"December 16, 2020",Lorraine Brocato,5.0,,I use them at work and then when I workout. I usually charge them overnight and I’ve never had them run out of juice. Love the way they fit and the sound quality is great. Even on phone calls. Wont disappoint!
"May 28, 2021",Ute,4.0,,"It is light weight and fits perfect, I’m ver happy with it, but it could have more volume when wearing only one earpiece."
"June 23, 2021",NW,1.0,,Earbuds are constantly disconnecting one ear at a time.  Happened on multiple devices that I connected to these earbuds.  Would not recommend.  They also do not cancel out exterior noises nor do they have a good sound quality.  I can say that the batteries never died so kudos to the manufacturer of the battery that went in these.
"January 4, 2021",Beverly E.,5.0,,"They are comfortable and stay securely in my ear during a fast paced walk.  Sound is good, too; I like that I can use one at a time if I want"
"March 5, 2021",Occidentalist,5.0,,"I needed ""sport"" type earbuds so they don't keep falling out of my ears and, after reading reviews, decided to try these. I am very pleased with my purchase! They fit well and have great sound for everything from podcasts/videos to music. Would definitely recommend!"
"March 8, 2021",Jeryl Simon,1.0,,I’m not technology-literate so maybe it’s operator error but I couldn’t get them to connect to my iPhone. They worked once but that was it. They say “power on” and connected but the phone never registers them. I’m not looking for anything fancy. Just want to run without worrying about my headphones falling out. Returning them. Maybe just a fluke pair?
"April 24, 2021",Daniel Pelissier,1.0,One,I returned them the immediately. The left earbud keeps repeating power on and never actually connected to anything. Horrible product looks and feels cheap as soon as you actually see it and get it into your hands.
"February 24, 2021",Van,5.0,,"What I like about the OCCIAM wireless headsets, the sound quality clarity for music and phone is Great!!! I wear them particularly when I am at work!! There excellent!! Don't get in way, no wires, 8hrs of play time,probably more, cause I don't use both at the same time. Would gladly recommend to others!!!👍👍"
"December 1, 2020",M. Shnayder,5.0,,For the price these are very good headphones. Decent bass and sound from these. You obviously can't compared these to 200 headphones but they are not meant to replace them. Very happy with performance for the price.
"January 16, 2021",shaun Goodrich photography,5.0,,"These are pretty good earbuds. I really can't even tell that they are on, and they do not fall out of my ear, like other ones do. I wish the volume would go a little louder, but it is sufficient. I also wish they have a wireless option so I could put it on my charging pad. Other then that they are great."
"December 10, 2020",Eric Allison,5.0,,I was looking for my first pair of earbuds on Amazon and when I came across these they spoke to me. Having the piece that goes behind my ears was important to me. These seemed to fit the bill and are priced right. I just got them and they are as good as advertised.
"July 16, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,"The only thing I dislike about these earbuds, is that they connect to my phone automatically…even when I don’t want them to. I’m constantly having to disconnect them, only for them to reconnect unprovoked. Aside from that- these are great. They stay in for long runs, great sound and noise cancellation."
"March 8, 2021",sandra palmer,5.0,,Love these and easy to work.  The button on the side is so helpful when you can't get to your phone and need to pause the music or answer a call.  The only thing is I have had people complain at times if the back ground is too loud.  It picks up sound in the back ground but other than that I love these.
"September 7, 2020",FordVaper,5.0,,"I like the carry case/charger, it's a nice size. I also like that I can use just 1 of them at a time. Good audio quality, comfortable fit. For the price point, I would recommend these to anyone looking for a pair"
"January 25, 2021",jmb San Diego,5.0,,I like that they are comfortable and easy to use with the push button - right and left side both work to answer a call!  I recommend these.
"November 26, 2020",Elite Tech,5.0,,Amazing ear buds for the money. Works great when watching movies with amazon fire stick. Holds a very long charge. Great quality at a even better price.
"January 24, 2021",Kindle Customer,1.0,,"They were great for two weeks....then one randomly disconnects for 20-30 minutes at a time. They also de-synced, with a momentary delay between the two ear buds. Tried to resolve the problems by various means with no luck."
"July 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"These Bluetooth ear buds are fantastic,the sound is superb and they are very comfortable.you can’t go wrong with them .occium you did a wonderful job at a very reasonable price.Some reviews said the volume is low I have a iPhone I go to my settings to  sounds & haptics  and slide headphone safety and turn up the 95 decibel,it give you a better and louder sounds .hope that helps ."
"May 24, 2021",Megan Hamilton,1.0,,They worked two days for me and after that they didn’t work. I did everything in the video. Can’t return them bc I threw away the box they came in. Don’t recommend these!!!
"January 16, 2021",Brdz87,5.0,,They have a great fit and great sound quality especially for the price! They stay in my ears better than more expensive air pods.
"March 9, 2021",Swayde Whaley,5.0,,"I ordered these because I am a mechanic and needed a headphone to stay in my ear throughout the day, they work flawlessly! Stay in my ear no matter what I’m doing, great sound quality and I never have had one die. The noise cancellation is great for when I’m using my 1/2 inch or 3/4 inch impact and they act as a ear plug with how they cancel noise."
"April 11, 2021",Kathleen C. Juras,5.0,,Great battery life and quality of product. I like that the ear phones wrap around my ears to not fall off when walking.
"November 12, 2020",AdrianCR80,5.0,,"Audífonos de excelente calidad, fácil de usar, el precio fue muy bueno y son excelentes para usarlos cuando salgo a correr. Muy recomendados!"
"April 11, 2021",Jeffrey Maselli,4.0,,"So far so good. Easy set up. Good sound quality but could be a bit more bassie. Water ratering could be higher instead of 5. They fit well  and stay put . The real test will be when im shredding a downhill on my bike! Don’t like that the lifetime warranty is only offered with a five star rating, but this is the unfortunate norm on Amazon."
"January 12, 2021",Jessica Peyton,5.0,,"The Occiam Bluetooth Headphones are the answer to everything I was looking for in a workout headphone! Finally, no issues whenever I need to adjust them and they don't fall out. I am so used to having headphones stop or start a song because of a simple press. These headphones have buttons that you push to start stop and also to adjust the volume! I am beyond thrilled that I made this purchase!!"
"May 11, 2021",katie b,5.0,,These headphones are wonderful! They are lightweight and the sound quality is very nice and clear
"February 1, 2021",Sandy Tabor,2.0,,"I have had these for about a month and a half. I really liked them at first. The sound quality was good for the price, and they were comfortable in my ears when working out. However, in the last few days, they have been not connecting well and cutting in and out. Unfortunately, this happened right after my return time had passed. I would not recommend these."
"November 3, 2020",Emilio R.,5.0,,"Comfortable to wear it, excellent sound, battery holds power for many hours. I use it to workout and jogging, keeps on place without falling from my ears. I would recommend good price, good product."
"October 22, 2020",Tiffany,5.0,One,"Apparently I have small ears, and finding earbuds that don’t hurt has been a challenge. These were recommended to me, and I’m so glad I bought them. In my picture you see the size difference of the piece that is at/in your ear. These ones are smaller, so they don’t hurt, they stay put, and sound great."
"April 7, 2021",pctrek,5.0,,The sound quality is really good!  Exceeded my expectations.  Lot of bang for the buck!!!  Easy to pair!!!
"September 21, 2020",Lucille,5.0,,"Compact wireless bluetooth earphones, when going out you also can easily listen to music, comparing to wired headphones, they are much more convenient.In particular, the headphones are very comfortable to wear, no pressure to the ears, no swelling pain.The sound is good and clear, there is no noise.The charging case can be charged and stored, with good battery life. It can be used for 8 hours at a time, which is quite good.It's really nice looking, stylish and comfortable to touch."
"February 18, 2021",David Cochrum,1.0,,"The headphones sound decent for the price, but you're certainly getting what you paid for. More importantly, the description is a bit misleading. There is a lifetime warranty, however, in order to ""activate"" that warranty, you must provide the seller with proof that you left a 5-star review. Or you can opt instead for another pair of free headphones. Buying a higher rating? Sure sounds like it."
"January 5, 2021",Mike Distler,5.0,,"I bought this as Christmas present for my wife.  Some head phones have a tendency to fall out of her ears but these have stayed in for her, even while running.  We both found them comfortable and they were easy to get paired with bluetooth devices. I was impressed the battery life and really like the display that shows how battery life is left. Definitely worth the money so far."
"March 22, 2021",Lauren,5.0,,"Item arrived on time with no packaging problems. The earbuds were easy to figure out and, after a quick charge, I linked the Bluetooth and was ready to go. Still going strong after 13 hours of continuous use with plenty of battery to spare. 10/10."
"January 15, 2021",Dawn H,5.0,,Bought them for my husband and he loves them so far! Very noise cancelling and sound like you are completely surrounded by just the music.
"April 7, 2021",Sam,2.0,,"These worked pretty well for a few weeks, but now if you go further than 5 feet from the phone or connecting device it cuts in and out."
"November 20, 2020",Elizabeth K Martin,5.0,,"So far so good, Sound is amazing. Reserve the right to change review after extended use. I've had bad luck with every other pair I've purchased with them shorting out and not working. Hopefully these are the ticket."
"December 1, 2020",Joe,1.0,2,"Defective, does not pair properly. Call quality cuts in and out. Has NO noise cancellation."
"March 28, 2021",Lori L.,5.0,,First earbuds that feel comfortable in my small eats and don’t fall out when I exercise. Finally!! Of course it’s a bonus that the sound quality is as good as advertised and they are simple to use.
"March 4, 2021",superdragon64,1.0,,"The biggest problem is the charging contacts, if you sweat these will be shorted and the earbud will reboot, killing your music and stopping your workout. Bad engineering and lack of testing. Sound quality is not very good, bass is outragously boosted and drowns out mid and top range. There was a lifetime warranty and I really wanted to like these but the design and sound quality just won't let me."
"October 2, 2020",scott braaten,4.0,,"Love them for the gym, not as loud as other earbuds but they fit and feel great. Could do a little better on sound quality but good buy for the money"
"April 21, 2021",RENE D NELSON,5.0,,"You can wear these for an extended amount of time  with comfort.  Fast, friend customer service. Easy to operate the controls for the functions on the earphones.  Great sound quality."
"May 17, 2021",Carrie Montez,5.0,,"Could you more bass, but you get what you pay for and for the lesser cost these sound great and fit well"
"February 14, 2021",Debra S,5.0,,Took me a while to pair it because my other devices wanted to connect to it. I had to shut all other devices off for my phone to find it t pair. But all is well with all else
"May 14, 2021",Peter R.,5.0,,"Easy setup, nice looking headphones. Sound is much better then I was expecting for Bluetooth headphones. I really like the battery readout on the charging base and each individual ear piece in the base as well as it charging. Worth the price!"
"March 5, 2021",David B. Berg,5.0,,"Very good sound quality for both phone and music, especially considering the low cost. Very light and comfortable on the ear."
"October 21, 2020",Kiesha,5.0,,"I am hard of hearing and wear glasses. The sound quality is better than any buds or headphones I have tried. They are secure, comfortable, and easy to wear with glasses. I can put these on in the morning and wear them all day without recharging."
"December 26, 2020",GROCKIN',5.0,,Love these! They are super comfortable and sound great!  Surprised at the amount of low end!  My kids are now jealous - as they like these better than their App le airpods.
"April 7, 2021",Mike Hartzell,5.0,,Definitely comfortable and quality headphones when taking phone calls. I would highly recommend to buy!
"May 6, 2021",BRIAN M DAVIS,5.0,,I just received them today and I love them. They are comfortable and easy to pair. They sit in my ear perfectly and you can use both or one at a time. Perfect for on the go.
"January 11, 2021",becki,5.0,,"Ready to go right out of the box, super easy to use and stayed on during yoga inversions...I cannot attest to the battery life just yet."
"January 3, 2021",Vincent Huffman,4.0,,"The sound quality is very good for the price. Battery life is amazing, not even below 75% after an 8 hour shift. Only complaint is a little static when running another app with sound with music going but it's not bad."
"June 16, 2021",Norma Kaplan,5.0,,Love the charging case. The ear pieces fit beautifully over my ears.  I hope to have these a long time.
"July 15, 2021",APRIL,2.0,,"Sound is ok, but microphone is garbage. No one can hear me unless I yell because the sound is distorted. You get what you pay for I guess and these are being returned!!"
"July 11, 2021",Aneela,5.0,,I’m in loved with these earbuds I use it when I go for long walks and it’s perfect the sound is good and the micro phone works like bomb
"May 19, 2021",GK,5.0,,These earbuds are stellar for the money and the sounds is outstanding if you like beat heavy music  without sacrificing clarity. Talked to a friend and he just payed over $100 for his latest headset and he was blown away at the sound for the price. This is actually the 2nd pair that I ordered cause I don't want to miss out if they sell out.
"November 14, 2020",M. Leclair,1.0,2,"I made sure the headphones were fully charged three different  times before running, and they continually turned on and off for my entire run. I returned them."
"June 10, 2021",Kingwade,4.0,,"Great buds, battery life is great, recommend to anyone, they work great with sweat and water,"
"June 10, 2021",DDominguez,5.0,,These were such an easy setup and the sound was awesome. I work out a lot and these stay put.
"May 4, 2021",rayorb14,5.0,,This product possesses great sound and battery life qualities plus a perfect fit over the ear lobes.
"March 4, 2021",B. Perroux,5.0,,"These are pretty great! I bought them to exercise in, since they have a little loop over the ears and won’t fall out. So far I love them. They give you 3 different size ear pads, which is great because I need the small ones, and I love how the case charges the headphones!"
"December 25, 2020",Bowstar,4.0,,"These Bluetooth sport earbuds are a good value: simply well designed with excellent sound at a very good price. Five stars for first impressions, but will reserve or subtract one star until after I use them for two years since other brands haven’t lasted beyond that period for me! If I get two years of use than I’ll circle around and give 5 stars."
"November 22, 2020",Lori Vankomen,5.0,,I'm so excited to use this for work! I work out of my home and have been tethered to my phone. I am so impressed with the ease of pairing and the clarity of the sound! The 100 plus hours you get is amazing! And so very easy to charge!
"December 28, 2020",Sue Givens,5.0,,"While these don't specifically advertise noice cancelling, the in-ear fit is so good that it does actually provide that feature."
"February 6, 2021",Wendy,5.0,,I bought these earphones just for running. I like that these have the over the ear loop because I have a couple of piercings that gets in the way and earbuds can easily fall out if they don't have that piece. They are comfortable and stay in the whole run. More importantly it lasts my whole run! I usually use them for my 9-10 mile rums. I haven't had any issues with the battery thus far. So far so good!
"April 6, 2021",Bookworm lives,5.0,,I love this item it charges quick and good to use. I would buy a other one for a gift to friends or family.
"March 2, 2021",LindaGallagher,1.0,4,"The headphones were easy to pair and charge. I was disappointed with the sound quality when viewing streamed movies and shows.  I had to turn the volume up almost to max in order to hear. That aside, I was pleased with my new headphones.  Two months later the left earbud stopped working. I repeatedly tried the instructions for fixing this issue. After multiple attempts I gave up. So, overall I rate this product one star as the cost is too high for two months of usage. Very disappointed."
"December 29, 2020",A. McMichael,5.0,,"They are comfortable and feel secure on my ears. I just received them and am excited to try them out, but so far they're exactly what I need."
"February 10, 2021",Lindsay Hill,5.0,,These wireless earbuds work great! Sound quality is very good and they are easy to connect to whatever device you are using.
"March 9, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,They stay on my ears well. sound quality is quite good.  I like the charging box as opposed to plugging directly into the headphones. definitely a welcome step up from what I have been using until now.  I recommend.
"March 5, 2021",sh68,5.0,,These are great. The sound quality is awesome. Just finished my first run and they didn’t hurt my ears or fall out.
"May 27, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"It was great and an easy set up to pair with my phone. However, the left ear phone has stopped charging and won't even turn on after the third use. I've only had these for a week. It could boiled down to not being able to handle my workouts (I do get pretty sweaty) but for something claiming it's ""waterproof"", it should be. Very disappointing."
"December 10, 2020",Sheila,5.0,,"I rarely write reviews but these are my 2nd pair of earbuds in the last 60 days and I just got them. First of all they actually stay on and in my small ears!!!! Even the iPhone earbuds fall out. Plus they were fully charged upon arrival.  I literally opened the box, put them on, went to Bluetooth on my phone and there they were. All in less than a minute!  Impressive"
"January 8, 2021",deitrie,5.0,,"It works great.. it took a little time to figure it out, but once I got both ear pieces to work together.. I'm very satisfied.. The help comments really do help if you're in a jam!"
"November 7, 2020",Danielle,5.0,,"Have been using these a couple days and so far I love them! They fit nicely in my ears and I don’t feel like they will fall out. I’m not a headphone buff but that sound is great for my use and it definitely cancels noise to the point where I didn’t realize right away my kid woke from their nap, oops 😅"
"June 28, 2021",Charles,4.0,,They are comfortable. Battery life is strong. Sound isn't great but for $32 I'm not mad about it. They work great. Mine didn't come with different size tips for my ears so I couldn't give 5 stars based on that fact so the noise cancellation is d.o.a.
"May 3, 2021",JaneJacks,5.0,,What I like about the wireless earbuds is how comfortable they are.  Incoming calls are very clear and the noise reduction feature works very well.
"February 15, 2021",Taylor Cameron,5.0,,"Best you can get for the price! Sound quality is fantastic and really blocks surrounding noise. Very comfy and I love the ear piece... way more secure than others I've had... I can wear these during any activity and not worry about them falling out. Battery life is long and after a quick charge in the case, they are ready to go all day again. I highly recommend!!"
"October 5, 2020",Dr. O.,5.0,,"This works as advertised. Has consistantly connected (and initial setup was straight forward / very low effort) after removing from case. The case setup with the phones is smart. The recharge in the case (which helps ensure you don't lose the earphones either) is fine to stick in the pocket of mens pockets but will be bulky for other styles. I wear mine for running, however, the microphone quality apparently is also good."
"January 25, 2021",CHoward,5.0,,Item as described. Nice little headset and works beautifully right out the box. Nicely packaged with adequate instructions. This is a keeper.
"May 24, 2021",Caltiki,4.0,,"They aren't the best sounding for music but I didn't buy them for that. While I'm working, walking, riding my bike etc. I listen to podcasts. These don't fall out of my ears. I had the ones you stick in your ears with no retention and they sooner or later fall out and get lost. Not any more........."
"February 26, 2021",Gina,1.0,,"I guess the ones I had were defective.  I charged them a whole day and when I used them, they went from 100% charges to 10% in like 5 minutes. Returning"
"February 1, 2021",clecocq1,2.0,,"Was fitting very well in my ears. Seems to be good quality build, nice charging box, but unfortunately was constantly cutting the music/podcast, sometimes every 2 or 3s during 1 min, sometimes not cut during 5min, but at the end cuts were always coming back. It is a pity because the sound quality was really nice."
"December 30, 2020",Grit,4.0,,"This product seems like it will be the right thing for my husband. Sound quality is good, he like the piece that goes over the ear versus just placing in the ear."
"April 25, 2021",AF,3.0,One,"Sound is muddy and tends towards base, fit isn't particularly comfortable but isn't too bad either. 5 star reviews give you a free Warranty so take these with a grain of salt."
"March 8, 2021",RoyZ,5.0,,Works as advertised.  I used several times already with no issue. Sound quality is good good for music and phone calls.
"March 21, 2021",jabbyabby,5.0,,I enjoy this for when I am exercising and walking! Quite comfortable and steady !! Love this product!!
"June 9, 2021",David A Johnson,5.0,,"The left ear bud will not charge, nor did it give any charging info on the ear bud. It also will not connect to my phone."
"January 15, 2021",siannea w.,5.0,,It's extremely easy to use which safes a lot of time when answering calls. I'm still learning about it will update review after testing.
"May 7, 2021",Nemeseos,5.0,,They stay in my ears. I can hear the music while mowing and provide great tone and bass.
"May 1, 2021",Joy webb,4.0,One,I wasn’t sure if the battery would last a full 48 hrs. I left them off the charger for 4 days and when I came back they were still working. The sound quality is great!  I made a good investment.
"December 27, 2020",Kris_C,5.0,,"They work really well. Good sound and the charging case is nice. Also nice that it shows the charge level. The bass is really good. They fit very well and I have small ears, so the fit is usually an issue."
"April 1, 2021",Deb D,1.0,,I liked the earbuds when they worked . I could only use them a few times. They didn’t stay connected. They wouldn’t charge. I had to return them. I don’t know what to try next. One star because that is the lowest rating. they won’t charge so a waste of my time and money.
"June 17, 2021",Max Powers,2.0,,Not bad for one time use. The left ear bud from brand new never charged and it’s now dead and outside of warrantee. I guess make sure these charges in the first 30 days.
"January 2, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,Just made the jump to Bluetooth earbuds a few days ago. So far so good; this product has been as advertised. Used it twice.
"January 24, 2021",Benjamin Johnston,5.0,,These headphones are perfect for running! I love how easy they are to connect to my phone. They also do a great job staying in your ear with the wrap around style. I've used these multiple times and am so glad that I got them! Battery life is great. I've had better sound quality headphones but these ones are very good for the price. Would recommend!
"November 16, 2020",Rommel Arias,5.0,,The volume output and noise cancelation are wonderful. The range between the headphones and the device they are connected too is great. I can walk around my house and patio without losing connectivity. Battery life is decent as well. The waterproof is definetely solid. I tested it out by using the headphones while it was raining and there was no problems at all. Great purchase for me :)
"October 15, 2020",Carolyn Rose,5.0,,These earbuds are awesome. Normal earbuds always fall out of my ears but these weightlessly fit around the ears and won't fall out! I did a run test and high movement test and they stayed comfortably in place. Sound quality is great. Super pleased!
"July 4, 2021",Kenneth Beasley,1.0,,"Overall worst headphones I have purchased... Volume controls don't interface with my phone and the overall volume is much lower than expected, range is too short even if my phone is in my back pocket the sound breaks up, the headphones stay connected in the case when it's closed...  Other than the price point I don't have anything positive to say..."
"November 3, 2020",smilesincamo,5.0,,Work fabulous the battery pack for the head phones isnt holding a charge for very long was dead by the end of the first day i had it.
"March 27, 2021",Jen Valador,4.0,,"good value for the price, doesn't cancel out other noises much but connects right away and sounds good"
"January 12, 2021",Heather Davis,5.0,,"So far so good, just received and checked sounds on all apps I frequently use. Pairing was super easy and I love that they automatically pair and unpaired at the touch of a button and when put back in the case. Will update on battery life later"
"January 9, 2021",whatdoidointhegym.com,5.0,,i like everything about these earbuds! very good deal for the price! well worth the money and my wife and i are very happy with them!
"May 18, 2021",Tammy McKissack,5.0,,"These are great! I often wear them around the house as I do my cleaning. The noise cancelling is amazing and they fit so comfortably snug in my ears, I can barely even hear the vacuum cleaner running! Well worth the money! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"April 14, 2021",Hunter,5.0,,The sound quality is great and bass is on point. Battery definitely lasting longer then expected when I bought them.
"December 1, 2020",DemandingSky,5.0,,"Feel amazing on my ears and stay in place. Love them! I don't care for regular buds as my ears are small, so these are just right. They are made of durable materials as well."
"June 18, 2021",L. Morrow,5.0,,Sound is amazing. Setup took only a minute. Does NOT slip out of my ears like every other ear bud I've ever tried.  Worth every penny and then some.
"June 25, 2021",Laura Brightwood,1.0,,The cord and its connection to the plastic charging case broke on second use. Sound quality is good. But I can’t ever charged again. Please replace.
"March 14, 2021",Mi B,5.0,,Sounds too good to be true I love this use one at a time n compatible n dos not failing my ears great product
"December 12, 2020",J-Dub,3.0,One,"These earbuds were okay, bass wasn’t as deep as advertised. The hooks around the ears were satisfyingly comfortable.. I gave the earbuds to my nephew."
"October 19, 2020",ViggFamily,5.0,,"Occiam's earbuds have great sound quality for listening to music and, so far, the battery life has been good.  During phone calls, the sound quality on the other end is ok to good."
"February 21, 2021",Bernard Mozdenski,4.0,,"Battery lasts a long time,  and they have pretty good bass for a in ear headphone. Only downsides not very loud,  sometimes have a hard time hearing people on the phone even at max volume; and they don't fit as well as I'd like. If I lose these I won't buy again."
"March 29, 2021",Jesse medrano,1.0,,"This is my first time trying these particular earbuds, I don’t know about “noise cancelling”  or “battery life” since the ear buds continually kept disconnecting and reconnecting and then disconnecting again from my phone which was sitting on a table 3 feet away from me. I would NOT recommend anyone to buy these."
"November 29, 2020",J. Johnson I,5.0,,Earbuds came in record time and arrived partly charged. I used them immediately and have been using them for the past 3 days on the same charge that it arrived with! These earbuds are the best sounding Bluetooth device that I have ever used and the battery life is nothing short of amazing!
"May 4, 2021",Jeff,5.0,,"Great fit, very secure, looks great. Great sound, excellent battery life. Good noise cancelation."
"March 9, 2021",Al T,5.0,,Really great product! Super cheap for the quality. I don’t like AirPods Bc they don’t stay in my ears so these are a perfect alternative with the over ear strap support for playing sports or working out and not worrying about them falling out. Super fast shipping. Easy to setup and use. Highly recommend!
"March 10, 2021",AZ,5.0,,"Great quality, sound, and fairly easy to program. A little trouble with using both on a few devices ."
"December 29, 2020",Ted,5.0,,"Pretty good! It's my first time using wireless and I am definitely not disappointed. The range is amazing, the sound quality had me shook, the microphone could be a bit better and it does cut out a small amount(but it comes right back). I love these headphones and they are the best I've had so far. Would definitely purchase more of them from this company"
"January 12, 2021",Jennifer Salorio,5.0,,"These headphones paired quickly and easily with my phone unlike several other pairs I have used. I love the charging case, as I with my old headphones I would have to remember to plug them in periodically and they would often be dead when I would go to use them. I also love that they come with multiple size earbuds - I need the smallest size and it can be difficult to find earbuds that stay in my ears but these are great!"
"March 12, 2021",Jonna Lowe,1.0,,When they first arrived I immediately paired them with my kindle which was the reason for the purchase. They worked exactly one time. I missed the return window so I'm out the cash. Bummer...........
"January 8, 2021",Tsitra,5.0,,Great sound and noise cancellation. Other buds kept falling off. These stay in and feel great. Don't feel like they are going to fall off.
"February 13, 2021",Jessica A. Thomas,5.0,,"Bought as a birthday gift for my Mother-in-law, her birthday is at the end of the month and I’ll be able to update review then.  She likes to talk on her phone hands free - she just tends to walk too far away from the phone so you can’t hear a good portion of the conversation, LOL!"
"June 24, 2021",J. Morgan,4.0,,"Really nice headphones. Especially for the price. I’ve only used them once, but I couldn’t be happier with the purchase. They sound and feel great!"
"May 20, 2021",midnight2am,5.0,,These are great little ear buds. Both the charging case & the ear buds have a great battery life. I
"May 18, 2021",Stephanie L. Young,5.0,,Very good sound quality! I bought because of the ear clips but I’m pleasantly surprised.
"March 18, 2021",SirFatNutz,5.0,,Works great as earbuds for my computer gaming. The mic is good too unless your running multiple sound sources through it then the audio cuts out. However if you use it as earbuds you can run all the audio you want through it.
"March 15, 2021",Paula M,5.0,,The ear buds have awesome sound quality and the ear pieces keep them on/in you ears!! Love them. Paula
"November 6, 2020",Jeff,1.0,2,These will not stay connected to my device(s) like previous buds I have that connect automatically every time. These lose their connection and have to be re-paired every time.
"April 2, 2021",Keith Pereiras,5.0,,I've had these for weeks and the charge they hold is amazing. I charge the pod maybe once a week but even doing that it's never dipped below 50%. I also questioned whether these would stay in my ears. I have been pleansantly surprised! Love it
"December 12, 2020",Dennis Smith,5.0,One,"Just received the headphones today.  Followed the directions and charged them first.  Could not find a Bluetooth setting on my SONY Smart TV.  Have to use a Bluetooth transmitter off the headphone Port which causes a lag in the sound. Works perfect using my computer, tablet and phone."
"January 5, 2021",kevin,5.0,,Just opened the package but if I give them 5 stars I get lifetime warranty? Although at first glance between the noise canceling/ sounds quality I'm not regretting putting 5 stars.
"June 27, 2021",Rebecca L Rattamasribounreuang,5.0,,"Comfortable, and easy-to-use plus same charger as my phone so easy to charge as well."
"January 24, 2021",Ricardo Gonzalez,5.0,,"I was thoroughly surprised by the sound quality and volume capabilities. The noise cancellation is amazing too, I hadn’t even noticed someone was talking to me. I’d probably never need to put the headphones at full volume. Also I bought these so I could discretely listen to music or Netflix while I worked and you don’t even notice when I’m wearing them."
"November 1, 2020",Heidy.,5.0,One,I love these audiphones... they're very comfortable and they don't move from their place despite strong movements... the most important thing is the good sound it has and the cancellation of external sounds is pretty good and the quality and price relationship makes me impressed I would recommend these audiphones to anyone who wants good sound without spending much.
"March 7, 2021",Mohammed Alzubaidi,1.0,,"initially, I liked them, I used them for 3 hrs without issue, second time I tried to use them, the right one kept cutting sound, so I turned it off because it was annoying, the left one stop working after few minutes, I am returning them."
"January 28, 2021",Victor Alvis,5.0,,Man the comfort fit around your ear and in your ear is remarkable. The sound is vivid and clear. Would buy again and again.
"October 21, 2020",J. Juenger,5.0,,"The sound quality is really nice, the ear buds fit great, & are comfortable over the ear. The battery lasts so much longer than my other buds did. When these eventually die on me, I will definitely order again!"
"May 1, 2021",March,5.0,,I love these earbuds. Easy to use sound great and the other person hears you as well.
"March 11, 2021",Shopaholic,1.0,5,This was okay for the price for exactly 2.5 months. Then it just quit charging. I couldn’t find a direct way of reaching their customer service so I am just stuck with a box that isn’t even heavy enough to be a paper weight.
"December 11, 2020",ArtaxWolf,5.0,,"Haven't tested it with my computer yet but with the phone it's great, and the earbuds fit my ears and are comfortable, which are usually an issue since I have small ear canals. The hooks and small covers make it a snug fit. The sound is really clear and the music quality sounds good."
"January 30, 2021",Jessica Swenson,5.0,,The head phones are great for every day use and for being active.  They charge easily and I would recommend them to anyone I know.
"June 27, 2021",DeDe,3.0,,I loved the product and used it mainly for work for a couple months after that both speakers shorted out and just completely gave up on me. 😭 however the sound quality ans battery life were the two things that amazed me the most about this product. I just wish that it didnt completely die on me.
"February 12, 2021",KISHA,5.0,,Nice addition to help me listen to music while running. Sound quality is nice and stays in my small ears.
"February 25, 2021",Colin Knight,2.0,,"I like the lightness and the fit. However, mine was one (of apparently many) that had non-functioning volume buttons. Tried a couple of tricks and couldn't get them to work on my iphone. So they're going back."
"May 24, 2021",DocShasta,5.0,,Love these ear buds! Pros: Comfort (They don't fall out like some I've had) Battery life (Can't remember the last time I had to charge the case and I use them several hours most days.) Resononably priced Cons: non currently
"December 17, 2020",AMR,5.0,,"They were delivered very quickly and will work perfect for Bluetooth & music, love that you can use them independently"
"September 5, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,These earbuds so far are very nice. I like how they fit and love the sound. It is clear and has good bass. I have only used them 2 times while I work out so I have not really tried to change songs or volume too much but when I did it didn't seem to work. I had to change it on my phone. I have gotten a phone call while wearing them and the caller was able to hear me clearly. I like the charging box too.
"May 30, 2021",Caughmans,3.0,,They work ok for the price.  Clarity on calls isn't great but music movies etc is good.
"June 21, 2021",Joe Hight,1.0,,Purchased.  Sound is good and battery life is great.  Unfortunately around 1 month in the volume buttons were non-responsive and telephone callers have a hard time understanding what is being said.
"November 28, 2020",Bella,5.0,,"My mother in law loves them! The sound is clear, it is perfect And confortable around the ear! Very happy with my purchase:)"
"December 3, 2020",claudia s.,5.0,One,"The most important thing about buying a pair of headphones was the microphone, the microphone works perfectly with these headphones even in places where there is a lot of noise. I am very happy with my product!"
"June 1, 2021",NM,5.0,,I have ipods but they fall out and didn’t want to spend more than $50 on a pair of earbuds that wrap around my ear. I returned a different brand and then decide to read the reviews on this brand & took a chance in ordering. I had them on for 3-4 hours at work and they sound great.
"June 20, 2021",VG,5.0,One,So far so good
"February 1, 2021",Andre Bullock,5.0,,"I bought these to supplant an existing pair of Bose wireless, not to take anything away but they were always falling out so my intent was to find earbuds that also secured on the pinna of the ear. These do both, staying in while walking and having a good microphone for taking calls while in motion. Excellent."
"June 19, 2021",No One,4.0,,Connect well and battery life is great but phone calls are a bit too quiet despite volume adjustment. Books and music play well despite call sound being too quiet.
"December 25, 2020",Dalton,5.0,,I love the size and wireless of the headphones. You can choose to just have one in your ear as they both have mics.
"January 1, 2021",Blanca S. Scott,5.0,,Super clear and easy to use. Does not strain ear canal like other in-ear buds. I love that I can use either one or both. Also has actual buttons so you know where to click I stead of frantically feeling around for the right spot. Replaced my Apple pods with these.
"March 11, 2021",Samuel Gonzalez,3.0,,You get what you pay for . Mine the volume buttons dnt work . But it links to my phone instantaneously and soo I use my iPhone to turn up or down the volume that way . Sooo that’s why I give it the 3 stars . Although it’s very comfortable on my ears . Haven’t had it on for too long . Bugs me I have buttons that dnt do anything 🤨
"March 25, 2021",Darren W.,5.0,,These are awesome! Worth every penny. I’ve only had them for a couple weeks but so far so good. I originally bought AirPod Pros and they kept falling out of my ears at the gym. These are a fraction of the price with the same features. The sound is great.
"May 26, 2021",venezuelanexile,1.0,,the audio quality of the earbuds is good however after only one month of use the earpiece broke on one of them. i tried gluing it back using super glue but it broke again shortly thereafter. unfortunately the return date has passed or i would return them and ask for another pair.
"April 16, 2021",Breton B.,5.0,,"Priced great, the best i've purchased out of the six different brads I used in the past."
"November 14, 2020",Adrianne V,5.0,,The quality is so clean and crisp. I’m looking forward to the 30 hours of play time. I am a truck driver so I always appreciate headphones that are comfortable with great battery life. 1/3 of the price of Powerbeats and I am already impressed.
"March 11, 2021",Khoff,2.0,,Bummer. One of the earbuds wouldn’t pair with Bluetooth. Attempted all the suggestions. Disappointing.
"January 13, 2021",Amazon Customer,2.0,,"Easy to use and stays put, but after a few months they won’t charge any more because they won’t seat properly in the charger and they cut out intermittently when they do charge."
"April 28, 2021",Julie C,5.0,,"I really like my earbuds! They hold a charge for a long time and they are perfect for my relaxing bedtime audibles! Best of all, they stay in my ears thanks to the flexible ear hooks."
"November 14, 2020",Ronnie Mann,5.0,,"this product is fine but im writing a new review because in my package, I received a scratch off to where I won another pair of the headphones. Once I notified them and went through process to get my free set, per their instructions, I still did not receive my free set. I emailed them a month later and they did not even respond.  Its seems to me that they just want you to give them five stars so their product can at top of the search."
"January 14, 2021",Mia,5.0,,"Package came very quickly. Earbuds were easy to set up and pair to any device. Sound quality is very good. For the price and quality of product, I'd say definitely worth the purchase. I have small ears and the buds were easy to put on and stayed on comfortably.  The earphones stayed charged for quite some time. I rarely have to charge them. The case they come in stores energy very well. I've had no issues with these earphones."
"December 7, 2020",L Lombardo,5.0,,I have small ear canals so have not had successes with any earphones.These were a miracle!.stayed in place the entire length of my walk! The sound quality was good and battery life was great also.For the price they are amazing!
"January 28, 2021",Matt O'Mansky,5.0,,My first (working) wireless headphones. Apparently many brands don't work with Google Pixel 3a phones. These paired instantly. They're also comfortable and sound great. I'm looking forward to taking them out on my next run.
"June 13, 2021",Jeremiah A. Fyler,3.0,,"Solid design, sound is great, life of battery is decent my only complaint is from people who I'm trying to have a conversation with on my phone and they have trouble hearing me. You can take one of them out and use it as a microphone but it's kind of annoying to have to do that."
"July 9, 2021",RL Posey,4.0,,Good value. Work well. I wish they included a charging cable because the only connection to the device is a USB-C plug.
"January 25, 2021",jeff,5.0,,Fits in my ear perfectly and doesn’t make my ears sore like other products. Keeps a long charge and sounds great
"October 27, 2020",Stephanie Rodriguez,5.0,,"It took some time to get used to the settings, but overall I really like headphones. I received the headphones on Thursday of last week and today (Tuesday) is the first time I have to charge the case. They definitely are noise cancelling which is nice when you are in a loud area."
"April 27, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,2,"Good customer service, good fit."
"March 26, 2021",Russ,5.0,,Love these earbuds. I bought several kinds but these are  the best so far. Sound quality is great. So comfortable in the ear and best of all they don't fall out thanks to that soft slim behind the ear piece. I would highly recommend these!!
"June 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I love the sound and the way they fit into my ears! I will buy for friends and family as gifts
"January 26, 2021",Lance Draper,5.0,,I got these to wear at work. It's a loud environment and is hard to hear my phone ring. So far so good. Sounds great
"March 21, 2021",Kayla,2.0,,"They were great at first. But now, 2 weeks later, I had both of them in & they started acting weird. The sound cut out of one entirely & the other one sounded like the speed of the music was being messed with."
"January 23, 2021",Ishop4deals,5.0,,Amazing they fit around my ear so comfortably. Fast delivery would definitely recommend them to anyone . Others I've tried hurts my ears theses are great!
"April 9, 2021",ml,1.0,,holy cow. less than 2 months old. and one of the headphones doesn't charge at. i thought the wireless charger mechanism would work better than a plug in charger. but it didn't work. i treat my equipment carefully but this product failed
"January 31, 2021",Lynn C.,5.0,,"The first pair that I got didn't work right. Contacted Amazon and got a replacement quickly. Easy to connect, good sound quality."
"July 10, 2021",Mario L.,2.0,,"The people do not clearly ear and the sound is not good. Amazon give star for up some products. It seems that Amazon gives stars to push certain products. The products on Amazon have deteriorated a lot, before I bought with complete peace of mind and knew that everything was Quality ............ Now not. Very poor quality products."
"March 9, 2021",Tyrone,2.0,,"Is dificult for people hear me by this device, beside, it disconnects a lot from the cell phone"

"February 14, 2021",Ngoc,3.0,,"I've only had this product for about a week but here are some notes: Pros: good sound quality, decent noise cancellation, & comes eith 3 sizes of the ear bud tips. Cons: doesn't fit my small ear that well (don't recommend if you have small ears), takes a while to put on, & randomly disconnects from my device and then reconnects often (?!)."
"March 19, 2021",Jonathan Gieseler,3.0,One,Cant complain about the headphones for $40 but the the lid on the charging case broke off almost immediately. They still charge but often i have to push them down harder because theres no more cover holding them down.
"January 8, 2021",Maria Guerrero,5.0,,"Great quality for the price! I got these for my husband who had a Bluetooth that would work sometimes. He drives a lot so he is always using it. So I found this on a recommendation from some website. Im glad I got these, he can hear clearly now and he hasn’t had any issues so far. Sound is great and there is no background noise. If you don’t want to spend so much money on air pods the get these!"
"February 9, 2021",Kathryn W.,5.0,,"Loved the earpiece fit, coupled with good sound quality.  Controls are easy to access and the box is convenient for recharging and storage.  So far, these exceed my expectation."
"August 22, 2020",Diana Montalvo,5.0,,These are nice and sleek looking earphones. The sound quality is great and the bass is incredible. These are a great value vs buying those expensive Bluetooth earbuds.
"April 28, 2021",Stephie Griffiths,5.0,,I love the blootooth ear buds because I could use them for my t.v. and my phone.
"November 10, 2020",Blind,5.0,,Great sounds...I love that these stay in my ears ...I have other ear buds but will not stay in my ears they fall out ..I love these

"February 19, 2021",Maddison Waddell,1.0,,They don’t plug back into the case properly so the battery just completely drains after every use.
"October 12, 2020",Keri Walker,3.0,One,These are soso.
"July 13, 2021",Reese,4.0,,"I received my earbuds on 6/23/21 and had them about two weeks when the left earbud started cutting in and out, finally it connected to my phone and had no audio at all. Overall the earbuds have been amazing and I have ordered a replacement. The process to replace the earbuds was quick and easy."
"December 15, 2020",ahhsimon,5.0,,"Great battery life.  I like that fact that you can use one ear piece alone and if individually,  it's 18 hrs total!"
"February 13, 2021",TheRichardsons,5.0,,"Thank you!  Very simple to use, holds a great charge, and quick customer service.  Fits with glasses comfortably but I haven’t tried a lot of activity while wearing.  It does pick up background noises during calls and recordings.  I use one side at a time and the charge lasts many days."
"May 1, 2021",Kayla Thompson,5.0,,"LOVE ITT!!! GOT THESE FOR MY DAD AND HE LOVED THEM OVER THE 200$ SAMSUNG EARBUDS I BOUGHT FOR HIM. TOO BAD I CANT RETURN THEM AND GET MY MONEY BACK. I GOT THESE ALSO FOR MYSELF, I HAVE SMALL EARS AND CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE AND REBUY 200$ APPLE EARBUDS.  TUH! BUT I LOVE THESE ! IM UPSET IF I LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT THESE!!"
"January 22, 2021",StealthOgre,4.0,,"Sound quality is good. The battery life allows me to only have to charge the unit every 5-6 days depending on my usage. Only issue I had with this was the case durability. Dropped it once and the lid became unhinged and lost the set pin for one side. Otherwise, if you are looking for bang for the buck, this item definitely fits the bill."
"April 26, 2021",JSilo,5.0,,love this while I am walking and doing my workout...dont feel down and life is longer.
"June 2, 2021",AmazonZ007,2.0,,I am otherwise happy with this earbuds except the issue that once in a while one of the ear it drops the connection.
"January 4, 2021",Tytus J. Spikes,5.0,,"These headphones work well, good volume and hold a charge really well. These heads up display of the battery level of the case helps."

"December 28, 2020",Dana Rosenberger,5.0,,Used my headphones as soon as I got them. Paired easily with my Pixel 5. Good sound quality and blocked out most of the background noise.  I rowed on my concept 2 with my kids playing(screaming) in the background and I couldn't hear them
"December 24, 2020",Cristina,5.0,,They are working well so far. Good sound. Good fit and been working for a few weeks. Have not had any problems with them to this point.
"June 29, 2021",Sal,1.0,One,Kept loosing connection from the moment I used them. Sent them back after use them for 45 minutes.

"February 6, 2021",Michelle JEFFERSON,5.0,,"They're pretty good, easy to wear. One of them stopped working but that's my own fault, either way very nice"
"December 28, 2020",Alberto,5.0,,"These are better than what I was wanting. Great clarity, excellent noise cancelling, extremely user friendly."
"May 6, 2021",Jennifer Allen,5.0,,"Very helpful for workouts, I don’t have to worry about them falling off nearly as much. Battery life is MUCH better than I expected. I like being able to walk around my apartment and still be able to listen to a video/podcast while having free range. Sound quality is pretty good, I wasn’t looking for the best sound quality earbuds anyways."
"March 1, 2021",Maria💫,2.0,,Not as expected or as advertised.  I use them but I can still hear everything around the room.
"December 7, 2020",Ralph K,5.0,,"Paid the same price for another """"wireless"" earphone with the cord connecting them and these don't have the connecting cord as they are truly wireless.  They come with a cool charging case and the battery life is good.  They fit well also.  Compared to the high price for other wireless earphones these sure do the job."
"January 22, 2021",DR. LOUIS,5.0,,Could not have made a better choice. Highly recommended. Sound quality is great. This is an awesome buy for 2021.
"September 19, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I am really enjoying this product so far. They keep a good bluetooth connection, unlike my last pair. They seem durable enough and they stay in my ear good. I have noticed a few times the volume buttons didn't seem to work, but whenever I try it with my phone screen unlocked they always work, so maybe it's just me. I love the long battery life they last all day no matter how much I use them. Overall they are great headphones well worth the price."
"August 7, 2020",Pierre,5.0,4,"I once bought another Bluetooth earphone with higher price, but it lose connection often so I returned it. This one seems to be stable, with lower price. The pairing and charging process is super easy. With this earphone, I pair my phone to listen to music when running, and pair my computer to attend online meetings. It works fine in either scenario. It's worth buying."
"January 16, 2021",stepccol,5.0,,So far so good. They stay on extremely well and that's exactly what I needed for working out and running
"October 4, 2020",Ivy,5.0,,Most comfortable in-ear headphones I have EVER had!!!! I have small ears and these fit right in without feeling like I have a grape shoved in my ear! And the sound is great!
"December 8, 2020",David Walser,5.0,,I’ve just received these earbuds and I’m so excited about them!! The sound is awesome and they way that it fits in my ear cuts out all outside noises and just gives clear sounds into my ear!! I haven’t had them long enough to review the battery quality but I love that you can charge the case that they are housed in and then take it with you in case you need a wireless charge later!!
"January 27, 2021",jen1989,5.0,,Long battery life and works perfectly for phone calls and music.  Couldn't be happier with our purchase.
"February 18, 2021",Pieter,5.0,,I like that these wireless earbuds fit very securely (the ones without earloops tend to fall out of my ears). Easy to connect to iPhone and battery life is great. Impressive product for the price - great value!
"February 3, 2021",Laura Thomas-Cole,5.0,,"These are my favorite ear buds! They work great, sync fast and the battery lasts for a very long period. I would recommend these to anyone."

"February 26, 2021",Wesley S. Boyd,5.0,,"I was quite impressed with these little headphones.  There was a lifetime guarantee in the box for as long as you own the product.  I think they are well built.  The box-charger is a clever design.  I would not mix down a CD with these, but they are fantastic for everyday use.  I highly recommend this product for daily wear."
"January 28, 2021",Thought,1.0,,"It leaves something to be desired. They did work, however not the quality I was looking for. Purchased beats instead."

"April 4, 2021",Jeff B,5.0,,"I am pleasantly surprised by these headphones.  They are inexpensive yet work very well.  They paired instantly to a few different devices.  The sound is very good.  They stay attached to my ear.  Overall, I'm extremely happy I purchased these."
"March 13, 2021",Fred T,5.0,,"The most important thing for me was finding a pair of wireless bluetooth earbuds that would stay on my ears while I went running, so I am very happy with these. They both stayed comfortably in place for my one-hour run with little adjustments needed, and the sound quality is good, too. Overall, I think these are a very good product for the price point."
"June 9, 2021",Godswill,5.0,,"Sound quality is superb. The battery life is unbelievably good, not heavy on the ear, Overall I live it."
"April 29, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,One,Fantastic buds especially if you have difficulties with insert ear buds remaining in place. The ear buds must be very close to your phone or they will disconnect and often cuts in and out during runs.
"June 9, 2021",Bruce,2.0,,"Initially they worked fine, maximum volume was low but I was please overall for the price.  But now the right ear piece display doesn't work or hold a charge.  Of course this just happens right after the return period ended. Will not buy again."
"February 16, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,One,These headphones Play good for a month then after that the left headphone the sound is very low you can barely hear it. I used these headphone to to run the treadmill and they wouldn't stay in my ear.
"June 10, 2021",Tigerrosesun,5.0,,For some reason I was having technical difficulties with one of the ear buds. Customer service was very helpful and they responded the same day. They also expedited the replacement set for free. Very pleased.
"February 15, 2021",deej,5.0,,"Good sound quality for the price! I do wish the ear hooks were longer and more flexible however but maybe they work better for other people. Nice smooth, stylish all-black look."
"February 3, 2021",TheDewd,1.0,,The sound keeps cutting out. Could only get one of the headsets to connect at a time. If the right one connected then the left one wouldn't and vice versa.
"January 24, 2021",Sr Dimas,5.0,,"I like everything about this ear buds, the sound is super clear, the noise cancellation is excellent and the connection range is great."
"November 24, 2020",E L,5.0,,"I was pleasantly surprised with these earbuds. I hesitated to use wireless (yes, I'm old school), but these proved to be easy to charge, easy to pair with my phone, and easy to use for a phone call. You won't be disappointed if you choose these earbuds."
"July 13, 2021",Rcky_Mntere,2.0,,They were great for a month or so and then the left ear piece started to cut in and out. Won’t buy again.
"October 19, 2020",DCE201,4.0,,Good buy worth the money sound is ok not great you can use them as head phones or individually charging case is great battery life is pretty good
"October 27, 2020",Hailey Graca,4.0,,They work great! Really happy with these headphones. I work in a factory so its very nosey in there. They cancel out majority of the machines going for not being an osha product. My partner uses one headphone while I use the other. We can go a good distance too and it still play without messing up. By the end of my shift there's still plenty of battery left in the charger and with headphones. I would definitely recommend these 👍🏽
"June 11, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,My package arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. The buds paired to my phone very easily and I haven't stopped using them since. It is comfortable on my ear as well. This product is worth the price. I am very pleased with my purchase.
"January 22, 2021",Bronwyn Hawke,5.0,,I love that I can use only one bud at a time. The sound quality is great and they feel very secure when wearing.

"May 27, 2021",Jami,5.0,,I just got them but I like how they fit and the sound quality is good 👍
"June 17, 2021",John Richardson,5.0,,The sound and connect quality is good and they have a very good web site
"February 16, 2021",Slim Shady,5.0,,I like the compact case that doubles as charger.  Easy to use and works as described.  Sound is good.
"May 9, 2021",Julio,2.0,,No lo recomiendo. El problema más grave es el sistema de recarga de loa audífonos. No funciona correctamente por lo que al guardarlos no se cargan. Hay que mantenerlos firmemente haciendo contacto con los pines que accionan la carga lo que es una molestia.
"May 8, 2021",PreciousGem,5.0,,The perfect set of headphones and I've tried plenty! I love listening to music on it cause the bass is incredible!!
"January 26, 2021",Dustin E.,5.0,,These are some great bluetooth headphones with great sound and battery life! It was super simple linking to my phone. Definitely worth it!
"December 19, 2020",Chris,5.0,,They paired with my phone instantly. Sound is clear but I don't listen to music.  Secure fit in ears so they won't get lost.
"November 6, 2020",Amanda Tipotsch,2.0,,"Do not buy these. Such a waste of money. Only one side works, the other one will not pair at all, I reached out to the company to ask them and never got any help. The sound cuts out on calls and when turned all the way up you can't hear still."
"March 18, 2021",frisbeecoach,5.0,,"Bass is much deeper and clearer than most of the similar priced BT headphones, which was my main hope"
"February 7, 2021",aristosound,5.0,,The noise cancelling headphones seem to work very well.  I use them while completing household chores!
"January 13, 2021",Melanie N.,5.0,,"Been using them off and on for a few days now and still have great battery life in the original charge of the case.  Great sound so far, decent outside noise cancellation, and live that I can use just one or both equally well. They paired very easily with my phone as well. Would recommend."
"January 5, 2021",Mari Lee,4.0,,Using for work on conference calls.  Audio and speakers work well. Maximum battery life is approximately 4 hours before I have to recharge.
"December 28, 2020",Brady H,5.0,,Theses are the best Bluetooth headphones I have ever owned. They're comfortable and have great sound. Long lasting too.
"April 20, 2021",Anthony,2.0,,"If youre looking for ear buds look somewhere else. Sound quality is absolutely terrible with these. I tried using them over the course of a month and every time the quality was so bad I just stopped using them. Battery lasts and while and theyre comfortable, but terrible sound."
"February 6, 2021",TheCartoonatic,1.0,,Left earpiece keeps reconnecting over and over. Ultimately it just stopped working. I've only had these for four days. They feel like cheap knock-offs and perform like them too. One of my biggest Amazon regrets.
"January 25, 2021",Jessica Cifelli,5.0,,"Only had them for a few days, but so far so good. Has an awesome battery life and the sound quality is great. However, after wearing them for a while, they made my ears sore. Even with the smallest earbuds, they are too big."
"June 7, 2021",Andrew A.,5.0,,I like how they are true wireless earphones with an  over the ear hook. It makes for easy running and working.
"May 31, 2021",jamesz,4.0,,"Have been using for almost 2 months. Good overall quality. I like wear them jogging. When on a phone call outdoor in windy weather, the person of the other side can still hear me clearly with little wind noise. On the other hand,  I was sometimes told my voice is a bit low. I guess that is because of the wind sound cancellation feature."
"December 1, 2020",C. Yoho,5.0,,Easy to use. Stay on!!! I especially like using these while walking or working in the yard and listening to audio books.
"June 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"I really never do reviews because I don't like affecting people who are working hard but this item I bought is terrible, I literally will either give it away or throw it, I already threw the box that's why I can't return it, maybe it was just bad luck but the sound is not that strong and the little rubber falls very easyly, also when I get calls doesn't work well."
"December 1, 2020",Eileen Jarman,5.0,,These are awesome. Great sound for the price. Love the way they charge. They are very comfortable. The sound quality is great for the price.
"March 25, 2021",Brandon W,1.0,,"They dont sit properly in the charger case so only the right one charges unless I lay something on top of them to hold them in place. Also, I have trouble connecting them to my phone and getting them to both sync. Super unhappy with these for all the positive reviews they got. Not worth the money."
"January 28, 2021",Big E,5.0,,I really really like these.  I'd love 'em if they announced my contacts when I receive a call...
"December 3, 2020",Carol L. Tucker,5.0,,I like these headphones for 1)comfortable ear ear hook 2)It uses USB-C charging cord ( same cord as my phone) 3)you can use one earbud at a time or you can use both at same time
"May 22, 2021",Anna Beckles,5.0,,"I have not been able to find comfortable earbuds, These are very comfortable, was easy to pair and connect to my phone or my computer. with each other very light in the ears.

"June 30, 2021",melanie,1.0,,"I’ve owned these headphones for a couple months now. The right bud doesn’t even charge anymore. I loved these headphones at first, but I went for a run yesterday after taking the headphones off charging case at 90%. Right bud died immediately. Just got to the gym and had the headphones charging all night, right bud won’t even turn on. Ugh bummer"
"November 6, 2020",Karissa,5.0,,I love the hassle free packaging. The headphones are awesome. I just received them in the mail && they sound great! I can’t wait to try them when I go running.
"July 12, 2021",Athena Pickup,3.0,,"These headphones were good, very comfortable wrap around the ear as someone who doesn’t like buds. I was very disheartened that they’re no longer charging after less than a year of use. Overall, a good buy if you need a spare pair."
"December 28, 2020",De Jemela,5.0,,These earbuds are exactly what I needed. They fit securely when working and sound great for the price. Great features
"January 17, 2021",Kristen,5.0,,Earbuds  don’t usually fit me well and are very uncomfortable. So far these have bee. Awesome and stay in place welll

"January 19, 2021",Abigail Occelin,5.0,,"These headphones are sleek and very nice design. They were easy to pair to my phone and worked instantly. The sound was clear when talking on the phone, but it’s not as loud as I would like it to be. Listening to music is clear and great sound."

"May 24, 2021",Angela Morales,5.0,,I love it! I’ve had it for a month and haven’t had to charge. They’re still at 83%. I do not use them for long periods of time though. The sound quality is great. They don’t fall out of my ears. Just 1000% worth the purchase!

"May 23, 2021",Lauren S.,5.0,,"I haven't used them yet but am giving 5 stars so I can get the lifetime warranty. I guess you have to read the descriptions and not just go by the stars to get a true picture of the product.  So far, they paired ok but the ear flap seems kind of short and not flexible enough to wrap comfortably around my ear."
"June 10, 2021",Claudia C,5.0,,"Very easy to connect to. Great sound quality and price. Comfortable to wear. I really like being able to easily see the charge to each ear bud and to only use one at a time, if you so choose."
"June 11, 2021",Alvaro A. Contreras R.,5.0,,"Hasta el momento todo me ha parecido genial, muy buenos tiempos de entrega, muy buena presentación y han funcionado muy bien mientras lo he probado, adicional dan garantía directo con la tienda. Lo recomiendo 100% para comprar. Sugerencia: manual de primeros pasos en video en youtube"

"February 11, 2021",Sara Lenox,5.0,,"Immediately took the headphones for a spin, they fit great in my ears and did not fall out.

I had an issue with the charging case and customer support responded within ten minutes to help me out."

"February 11, 2021",JM,5.0,,"So far so good!  I'm impressed with the ease of setup, pairing, and controls.  They work perfectly with my Android phone.  Music and phone call sound quality is very good."
"February 12, 2021",Jason Kimball Baker,2.0,,"I've bought three or four pairs of headphones like these, and in all cases, including this one, one of them broke fairly quickly for reasons I couldn't discern, and they come unpaired constantly when I'm running, which is infuriating. This is the last pair of headphones like this I'll buy."
"March 8, 2021",Greg Pedroza,5.0,,"These are by far the BEST I’ve ever bought. After I charged them, I tested them out for over and hour and it only used 3%. They are comfortable and adjust perfectly to fit and lightweight you don’t notice. The sound is incredible."
"May 24, 2021",TURK182,4.0,,Nice ears. Wish i knew if the number was for the buds or the case. I cant tell. But they sound good and fit well.
"July 1, 2021",KENT JOHNSON,1.0,,"Sound quality was tinny at best. The ear loops stay as shipped. They don't conform and break easily without trying to adjust. The batteries quit charging at 6 months. The charger lid hinge disengaged on one side from the beginning. Oh, the charging USB cable has an odd end that plugs into the base (not USB to micro or mini)"
"March 18, 2021",Linda m.,3.0,,Didn’t fit my ears and were very uncomfortable. Company issued return and apologized. So I am good now. Just wasn’t for me.
"May 4, 2021",Joella Meeks,5.0,,This fits perfectly on my ears They usually fall off and sound is amazing.  Love this
"June 22, 2021",Leah and Bill Burgoon,3.0,,When playing Spotify the sound cuts in and out quite often. Really not worth using.

"November 6, 2020",Tara,5.0,,The earbuds and case were fully charged within the hour and the sound is fantastic! They are very comfortable too.
"January 26, 2021",G. Truskett,5.0,,"These earphones are not only comfortable, the sound quality is great.....I recommend highly"
"January 9, 2021",Amanda Larson,5.0,,"Muddy sound, poor lows, treble is indistinguishable. good for phone calls, not great for music."
"April 12, 2021",steve kenuk,5.0,,Unbelievably easy set up and I love the feel of the year loops. I can’t wear regular earbuds because of anatomical mismatch and these are perfect as is the sound quality.
"March 30, 2021",Linda Gordon,5.0,,Item arrived on time. I personally can’t wear them very long but they do the job.
"November 13, 2020",Lacey Blackham,5.0,,"These are amazing $25 head phones. I wouldn't expect beats, but you aren't paying for those. They do exactly what they claim, have a great sound quality and battery life. Very happy with my purchase!"
"January 13, 2021",Victoria Cross,5.0,,Great quality for the price. My son loves them and they are used all the time so he van enjoy things on his phone.
"December 22, 2020",Beau G.,5.0,,"These earbuds were exactly what I was looking for: a pair of Blutooth earbuds that could be used either together or separately to play music from my laptop, my phone and anything else that accepts Blutooth!"
"October 16, 2020",Phillydachef,4.0,,"The headphones are a great product.  They feel good in my ears even with a mask on.  Pairing them to my phone was a snap. The sound quality is pretty good despite its affordability. I tend to think you get what you pay for.  Beyond that, I really like how either side can be the dominant controlling side."
"March 2, 2021",Prime Addict,4.0,,"These are really good ear buds, and a really great price. Just a bit heavy for me."
"December 26, 2020",Mai Ong Moua,5.0,,"Really good quality. Doesn't hurt my ears, I don't like when my ears hurt after using headphones. The sounds are great, don't even need to make it loud. Battery life is awesome. Connection to phone is super simple."
"March 11, 2021",Robert Kimberlin,1.0,,"I successfully connected these to several devices and although it controls the device with the buttons, there is absolutely no sound.  Too bad I did not test them before my return period expired."
"January 21, 2021",NK,1.0,,Sound quality is not very good and you need to keep your phone very near for better connection
"February 5, 2021",doc.m.1959,1.0,,"I leave the headphones in the charger, watch it charging, went I use them after charging overnight, I get about 1 hour worth of use before I get the low battery signal. I have tried everything to get the reported battery life. Nothing worked. I guess I got what you paid for!"
"April 27, 2021",Kellie,5.0,,"These connect really easily through bluetooth and are exactly what I was wanting. My original case/cord wasn’t charging. I reached out to customers support and they emailed me some  easy to follow directions for things to try. When that didn’t work, they quickly sent a replacement. Excellent customer service!!!"
"June 24, 2021",Michael D Morrissey,5.0,,"Great product, for a reasonable price. Bought these for the gym. Comfortable fit, great sound, and the noise cancelation blocks out the roid ragers wonderfully."
"April 20, 2021",Rick B.,5.0,,These are awesome! Great sound and comfortable. Exactly what I wanted.
"March 6, 2021",Sayulita,5.0,,"The sound quality of  headphones are far more superior than the ones I had! Noise cancellation is very good, phone conversations are clear and crisp!"
"May 1, 2021",Selena,5.0,,These have worked great. I can hear clearly and I don't have to worry about them falling out of my ear. The case stays charged for days. I leave it in my car so that I always have them when I'm driving.
"May 3, 2021",Cindy DelZoppo,5.0,,Love this product- I have tiny ears and other products are way too large. These fit perfectly Highly recommend
"January 9, 2021",Sage,5.0,,These are pretty great. I had them for a few months now and i recently had one go missing. Turns out i put it in the wash. A whole wash cycle and hours of just sitting at the bottom of wet clothes and surprisingly it still works. I'm more than impressed and honestly very thankful since i hate having just one earphone. I say they're worth the money after that
"May 9, 2021",Faith,1.0,,"Battery life is amazing , but everyone seems to barely hear me when I attempt to use them , I can hear perfectly from them on my end , but the receiving end of the call has a hard time hearing me everytime =( Wouldnt purchase again , only for that reason."
"June 8, 2021",jenise,5.0,,"nice quality earbuds, sounds good and like not having any cords"
"January 13, 2021",Dana Brooks,5.0,,These earbuds have the best sound I've heard out of all the ones I've used and had. I always have an issue with earbuds actually staying in my ears but these ones stay in so amazingly and are so comfortable. I'm really truly grateful to have found these
"June 18, 2021",Julie S.,5.0,,"I love these ear buds. They are very comfortable, the battery life is AMAZING and I really like the feature that shows the amount of charge left. I loved them so much, I bought a pair to leave at work and a pair for home. Quality of microphone for phone calls could be improved, but I bought for music listening primarily."
"June 3, 2021",Kristyn Killian,5.0,,Bought these as a gift to replace broken beats and they love them!! Definitely a good cheaper option. I would purchase again.

"February 9, 2021",John M,5.0,,Sound quality is excellent. Battery life is long. And customer service is outstanding.
"January 30, 2021",Austin,5.0,,These headphones do everything as advertised. They have great sound and I really enjoy that they switch to mono from stereo when only using one. They don't slip or move around at all when exercising. Can't beat these for the price! 10/10 recommend.
"July 17, 2021",Rev. Mark,4.0,,"These have worked flawlessly, so far, since I received them. Comfortable and clarity is superb!"

"March 11, 2021",Edward,5.0,,Great sound!  Great Mic! Love that I can use one earbud while the other charges!
"December 13, 2020",Brian Laura Underhill,5.0,,Ear buds stay securely on the ears and provide nice sound. The case charges with a USB-C cord with is great.
"April 20, 2021",ShaneC,3.0,,Not bad but not great. Sound quality is not very good but you get what you pay for
"March 5, 2021",rhodeislandisredis,1.0,,Item received was used and not new. No plastic wrap. Finger prints on item and ear wax on ear buds. Instructions wrinkled. Disappointed.
"January 12, 2021",George Corzo,5.0,,"Great price and work the same as most expensive ones. They are very comfortable with a bendable rubber piece that wraps around the ear. The ear wraps are soft and flexible and not noticeable. The earbuds fit great and I have no fear of them falling out. Also, microphone for phone calls is very good, people I've called said they hear me loud and clear, no buzzing or static."
"March 18, 2021",Alohawahine,5.0,,Just got these.  1st day so far Great after I got them to pair to my iphone.
"April 26, 2021",Jim Alexander,5.0,,These earbuds are awesome and paired easily with my android phone. Thanks
"October 18, 2020",donald chavis,5.0,,Earbuds are great as expected. Quick to charge and both earbuds paired together and with my phone real simply. Only used for a little while but everything is good so far.
"May 29, 2021",John W Clark,5.0,,Amazing coverage area.  Solid product with comfortable design and professional design

"October 24, 2020",Nailah,5.0,,Great product. I was looking for something that was not noise canceling and these are perfect. The traveling case is small and compact. Excellent battery life

"March 2, 2021",Mark Ruiz,5.0,,They sound great with noise cancellation and  keep charge longer then expected.
"March 8, 2021",Gino Petitti,5.0,,"This and the rebrand under veatool are the BEST headsets around for the money!  Wireless charging using the charging case, very comfy and the sound isolation and sound quality rival headphones 4x the cost.  i now have two of these under different brands so I always have a backup.  If you want super high value, this is it!"
"March 24, 2021",GM Swans,5.0,,"So far, I'm pretty happy with these. I can use one at a time ( either one) and they stay on my ear during running and biking. Sound quality is good for me."
"March 4, 2021",Megan Sherman,5.0,,The headphones are great. The case is about the size of a bar of soap. Which is nice. If only it had some like rubber or silicone tread on it somewhere so the case wouldn't be as slippery as a bar of soap. Over all great buy.
"April 7, 2021",Micah Stone,1.0,,"These are really cheaply and poorly made. It’s too bad because the design is quite good. The Bluetooth connection is awful and the charging case is terrible and doesn’t work in so many different ways. I suppose it’s my fault because they are pretty cheap, but that really shows up in the product quality. They broke after about a month and a half."
"November 14, 2020",Daisy,4.0,One,These headphones are pretty awesome for the price! The case itself doesn’t show any led light showing the charging for the case? Not sure if I missed it or not that would be the only minus for me but overall decent product.
"June 1, 2021",Joanne,5.0,,"I didn't like the fact you HAD to give a 5 star review to receive a ""lifetime"" warranty. Only received the item today so I cannot give a fair review but I DID want to register it! WTH!"
"February 2, 2021",Trae Schaefer,5.0,,Great earbuds for the price.  Using them for exercise and they stay on with no problems
"December 12, 2020",Anthony,5.0,,Great product fast shipping very good sound quality battery life lasts all day I like the fact that you can have one in your ear while the other one is charging
"February 10, 2021",Effren,3.0,,If ur looking for a earbud for just music these are perfect. As far as calling it’s a good 2 second delay in them plus they don’t pick up what ur saying if you choose to do say what you want to text. You have to scream the words and only then will it detect part of a word. These are for working out and listening to music ONLY in my book not calling. I’m going to return mine ASAP.
"May 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I've had these for a couple days now. So far I am impressed. Sound is clear, balanced. Easy set up. I'm not tech savvy and this was simple. If they continue as well as they are now, I would purchase again."
"March 24, 2021",Amazon Customer,1.0,,"This was a backup pair of headphones I used maybe 10-15 times over 5 months. Took them out of the bag one day and there was apparently no charge left and then they wouldn't charge at all.. The case won't take any power, I have tried all types of cords and adapters. Spend your money on a real par. Buy once, cry once."
"January 17, 2021",SP,5.0,,Finally some headphones that work! Spectacular battery life. Prompt delivery. Thank you.
"February 15, 2021",Jason,5.0,,"The bass surprised me, coming from in the ear headphones. I do think these will work great for working out.."
"October 23, 2020",Nick,5.0,,Just hooked up my new ear buds to my phone and it was very easy. The sound is great and has good base to it.
"November 4, 2020",Smart Buyer,5.0,,"What an amazing product for such cheap cost! I like the fact that unlike Samsung or Apple pods, these go over the ears."
"October 16, 2020",Patricia,5.0,,"This review is from wearing the earbuds for just 1 day (10 plus hrs) So far I'm 100% satisfied. The earbuds are lightweight, doesn't not hurt my ear (at times forgot it was in my ear) sound quality is very good and great battery life. I also like how the case tells you the battery life and that's its a hard case."
"January 30, 2021",Mom³,5.0,,"Perfect so far. Just delivered yesterday.  Easy to pair,  comfortable. Nice sound, cute, nice casing."
"February 4, 2021",Linda Newton,4.0,,Love these earbuds can wear one if you choose too. Also the battery life is excellent
"July 6, 2021",JCHB,5.0,,I like that they go in your ears but didn’t really like the quality of this item.
"December 15, 2020",Roxanne,5.0,,Super easy to pair with my iPhone X! So far great sound quality. I love that you can just use one of the earbuds if you need to!
"December 21, 2020",Ann,5.0,,"Yay!  I think I have finally found the right wireless headphones for me.  I must have weird shaped ears because all the other ones I’ve tried fall out when I’m running, even with smallest ear bud.  Sound is great and ear pieces are comfortable!  Hooray!!"
"May 12, 2021",Angela Thompson,5.0,,"Got them for my boyfriend for work, he does landscaping, he has yet to run the battery out before the end of his day. And the sound quality is fantastic the loud equipment serves no problem for him listening to his music and I can hear him quite well whenever he calls without me or him having to ask what back and forth. I would definitely recommend!"
"October 22, 2020",randi,5.0,,Got these for my husband and he loves them so far. The battery percent indicator is neat and very easy to charge.
"May 30, 2021",Gemqueen,5.0,,These are great. I have ordered some for the whole family!
"May 10, 2021",Seanhanthorn,5.0,,The sound quality is amazing and they are very comfortable
"February 4, 2021",Mbear44,5.0,,"Very pleased with the quality of the headphone , arrived fast and were a breeze to set up"
"October 25, 2020",Jason Adams,5.0,,Battery life is excellent. Sound quality is incredible. Price is affordable. The only complaint is that they only come with one size ear bud cover. Luckily they fit my ears pretty well. Highly recommended.
"May 28, 2021",Tina L. Petersen,5.0,,"For the price, these turned out to be great! Very happy with the way they fit around my ears and the sound is great. I have Samsung Galaxy earbuds and honestly they sound just like those! What a bargain!"
"February 18, 2021",Nate,5.0,,I've had them for two days now and I truly enjoy them. They are simple to use and they do not fall out of my ears when working out. I love the fact that they are sweat proof as well. I also like how each ear piece has their own individual battery life indicator when being charged so you know that they are charging properly. Overall extremely pleased with this product so far.
"April 18, 2021",Abby,4.0,,"The battery life is absolutely amazing. I only need to charge them MAYBE once a week after using them daily at the gym. The only downfall to these is one side will randomly cut out and stop playing music for 30 seconds and then start playing again. Some days it happens more than others, and it’s very annoying during a workout. Other than that, they’re good!"
"February 1, 2021",Drew from Jersey,5.0,,"They work great, love the sound. Nice Bass. Been able to test the battery life yet."
"July 10, 2021",Kelly Andino,5.0,,I love these earbuds.  They are very clear and comfortable!
"November 14, 2020",Ronnie S.,5.0,,"Since my ears are so small, regular ear buds want stay in my ear canal.  This was the best decision I made to keep them hanging onto my ears."
"December 31, 2020",Tom S.,5.0,,The sound is great and the wrap around ear piece is nice and soft. Had other ear pieces and they would work their way out when talking or eating. Constantly having to push back into ear and often accidentally hanging up. I don't think these are going anywhere. :)
"December 16, 2020",jeromie renfro,5.0,,Good quality product fast delivery I love the sound they're really nice I love the dick connect instantly minute you pull them out of the box
"May 15, 2021",Tiffany Milton,5.0,,I love the case! Fits comfortably in my small ear canal. Sound quality is amazing! Battery life is incredible. I had it in my ear from about 9:30am and I didn't get the battery low notification until around 7:45pm that same day. I am just so so happy with this product.
"May 29, 2021",United,3.0,,"These are perfect for listening to music or podcasts.  When I use this to talk on the phone, I am told the sound is muffled so I cannot use them for that purpose."
"February 11, 2021",Mortis101,5.0,,I just got these but they are awesome so far! They do everything I want them to. Hopefully I won't need to use a warranty but if I do they have one.
"October 29, 2020",JTG,5.0,,"Very good value.  Fits very comfortably, and my ears have had challenges with many others.  Very good sound, at least for spoken voice.  Hopefully they last!"
"December 5, 2020",Mario Lewis,1.0,,"When I got these back in December I wrote a 5 star review saying they were light, fir comfortably in the air and has great sound quality.  Now less than six months later my opinion on this has changed.  Everything I said previously was correct but it's been less than six months and one of my ear buds no longer work.  Such a waste of money  Not worth the buy."
"December 28, 2020",Amzmomma,5.0,One,"Comfortable, quality sounding headphones that have a great battery life! Stay put in your ears while exercising."
"May 21, 2021",G. Monokian,5.0,,Totally shocked at quality of product at this price point. I expected it to be just OK but it's really excellent.
"January 5, 2021",Ashxo,5.0,,Loved them! Great sound quality and they connected with my smart watch super fast and easy!
"January 5, 2021",Matthew,5.0,,Love the design and great for working at my desk and listening to music also love the sound quality.
"May 8, 2021",Thatguy6631,5.0,,"They arrived early, synched up quickly, and sound great."
"January 11, 2021",Rence,5.0,,That is great wireless earbuds for me.. sound quality is good also the battery is longer..
"January 6, 2021",KAREN ANDERSON,5.0,,Pricier than most moderate earphones. Hoping for the best. Will comment more in a few days
"December 8, 2020",Kim T,5.0,,Just received - earbuds were fully charged and the case was 75% - Easy peasy to pair and use.  Like how they fit around the ears - nice and comfy. Incredible shipping (same day - awesome)  So far so good!
"May 18, 2021",Faith4u,5.0,,"These are the best earbuds so far, I've purchased other earbuds and kept having issues , ie only could hear out of left  ear.  It was very frustrating.. the Battery life for these ear buds is good, noise cancellation. I am so glad a friend recommended these earbuds."
"February 24, 2021",Paul L Jack,5.0,,Works great with both tablet and android phone. Would definitely recommend.
"January 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,I work construction so I usually one wear one on the job site. They where great right up until they sucked. I used the left for about a month and a half before the blue tooth would cut in and out. I would get every other word or every 5th word. I switched to the right and it work great for about 2 weeks. Same problem. Battery life is hit or miss.
"February 26, 2021",Matt,1.0,4,"I read the reviews and thought this would be a great solution for music when I'm running. Upon opening these, they paired easily with my phone and they fit well in my ears. The hooks worked well for keeping them in place during the movement of running. However, when I run, the sound cuts in and out with each stride which pretty much renders them useless. I wish I'd have spent the money elsewhere. Update: After 3 uses, the left earbud completely quit working and won't even power on. These things are the biggest waste of money. I'm really disappointed."
"March 20, 2021",Lovely,5.0,,"These headphones are sporty, perfect for my job where I’m always on the go. I also like the fact that you can use the headphones individually while the other charges."
"May 14, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"The headphones work great but never really shuts off after charging most likely due to a loose connection between the charging port and the actual wireless ear phones. It’s definitely not a tight fit. Because of this, the head phones always inadvertently connect to my phone whenever they’re in range which  also runs the battery down even faster."
"July 10, 2021",Caityk,5.0,,Really good quality and great sound. Great for the price.
"January 5, 2021",Bev A.,5.0,,These Bluetooth earphones are just what I wanted.  Great sound of my music...phone call clarity...so comfortable to wear....great for my power walking
"November 23, 2020",Melanie,5.0,,Sound quality is great! Unbelievable base! They are very comfortable on your ears. Good quality and great customer service. Excellent price!
"April 26, 2021",Antonio Celli,4.0,,Works well but have not used them a lot yet. But sounds good

"January 10, 2021",Juliana,5.0,,Great quality sound and stays in my ears while I work. Battery life is amazing honestly.
"June 6, 2021",Raven Nantz,2.0,,These headphones were perfect and worked well for several months. No issues with connecting and great sound quality. Our only issue is that after about 5 months of use the right one stopped working altogether and the case wont charge them anymore. Super disappointed because these were really good for the price.
"May 26, 2021",Kim,1.0,,"While I initially liked the earbuds, once I connected them to my P.C. to us for a game all of it went downhill. I got an error message stating that the earbuds only supported mono and that I needed to connect a stereo or multi channel audio device.  However, the product specs state that they are stereo earbuds."
"July 6, 2021",Nolan,4.0,,Really good for the price. Sound quality is good but not great. Could be my phone but I can't cycle through songs on earbuds only volume and answering ending phone calls. Battery life is great and dropped them in pool of water and they still work fine. I would buy again for sure.
"April 9, 2021",Anna,5.0,,Have just received my headphones and they're great! I got them because my previous wireless headphones would never stay in my ear and became a hassle just trying to do simple tasks with them in. These stay put and the sound quality is much better.
"October 14, 2020",aisha smith,5.0,,I love the way they fit in my ear they aren't noticeable the sound is perfect this is something I would purchase again if needed
"January 2, 2021",Amazon user,5.0,,"These headphones works great, I love that they do not fall off while I'm working out. I have small ears and most headphones do not fit my ears. These all provides excellent sound with my music."
"June 5, 2021",Angel Fly,3.0,,"It's ok, the noise sometimes gets disconnected. Use it in the meantime."
"June 17, 2021",The Q,5.0,,I use this at work bc there's a lot of background noise there.
"April 4, 2021",andi allen,5.0,,I have bought several pair of head phones over the years. These head phones are the best I have ever bought. I'm very happy with these head phones and I'd recommend them to everyone I know.
"May 11, 2021",jalis,5.0,,Excellent Wireless Headphones crystal clear sound and music without distortion.

"June 16, 2021",Danica,5.0,,I love how they charge in the case instead of having to plug in the headphones like my last Bluetooth ones. Sound quality is great and I also enjoy the different size ear pieces.
"April 5, 2021",Thane Fuller,5.0,,"It is great headphone,  I charge a base once per week, microphone isn't perfect but it is good. Very convenient for ears."
"September 18, 2020",Misaki,5.0,,"Gave this to my mother in law and she loves it. They're very easy to use, quality is great, the sound is pretty good and they're quite comfy."
"May 6, 2021",aron sprague,5.0,,Buy them. Don't be fooled by how inexpensive they are.
"May 4, 2021",joyce kuklewski,1.0,,Only had for 3 days and the right side sound kept going in and out.  Reset multiple times and then R stopped altogether.  Not happy with product at all.
"May 4, 2021",Torrie N.,5.0,,Bought a pair last month. Liked them so much I bought a pair for my boyfriend!
"February 22, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,They fit my grandson’s ears and he loves how clear the sound is and how long the batteries last👍❤️
"January 7, 2021",Kindle Customer,5.0,,Super quick delivery. Can even hear my music while on my lawn mower. love the way they feel and they don't hurt my ears. Totally recommend
"February 22, 2021",The BigDog,5.0,,The cover was lost for the left earbud and they were very loos when I was wearing them.
"December 9, 2020",Rev. K,5.0,,Yes!! Loved them. Very comfortable behind the ears. Noise canceling. So far the charge is great! Charges quickly!!! Im satisfied. Worth it.
"February 7, 2021",Michael Mackay,1.0,,"This was a decent product for about two months. It doesn't have great sound and on its max volume it still doesn't block out external sound, but they stayed in my ears during a workout which I appreciated. I also liked that it had a digital readout for battery life. Unfortunately, after the second charge they pretty much stopped working."
"December 7, 2020",Shannon Davis,5.0,,Comfortable wireless earbuds that STAY PUT! I love the charging carrying case. Super convenient!
"January 16, 2021",Juan Gonzalez,5.0,,These bluetooth headphones are awesome. I'm a mailman and I listen to music all day long. I use one side at time  and have gotten 9 plus hrs out each one. They sound incredible  the only upgrade I did was buy foam ear tips I didn't  like the tips it came with kept coming out of my ears. Other than that you can't beat them on price and quality highly recommended
"October 14, 2020",DRS,5.0,,So far they work great. The only thing I don't like is they won't pair to more than one thing at a time.
"November 24, 2020",Timothy Evans,5.0,,Great product for a very nice price 👍. Sound is awesome 👍 Comfortable on the 👂👍 very nice guys

"May 4, 2021",Shane Tooker,5.0,,"I bought these headphones because they claimed that the battery would last 8 hours. I haven't tested that, but I've been able to wear them all day at work and listen to music without having to charge them in the middle of my shift.

"September 14, 2020",Edward Pompa,5.0,,"These earphones are great at this price point. Quality of case,ear phones...fit and various ear pieces...really good. Easy bluetooth pairing and good sound quality. The ear loops keep the phones secure without having to stick the ear buds way into the ear."

"October 26, 2020",Dr. N,4.0,,"I came upon this one after trying out three other sets of earbuds and this one, by far, is the best of the lot.

"April 13, 2021",Lman,1.0,,I was very happy with the sound quality but in just a 3 short days of use the left side stopped working. It was not dropped or anything it just simply stopped working with no sound. The light flashes like it is pairing and it is fully charged. Very disappointed that it just stopped working. The right ear bud still works but the left one does not.
"May 8, 2021",mma,4.0,,"for the price great product, sound quality is above average, totally happy with the battery life, use all day at work(just use 1 earbud) time I get home needs to be charged,  just swap it out for the other one and go to the gym😁"

Sound quality is better than most headphones and the charge lasts a long time. I tried running with these today and these fit snug in the ear and never felt that they were going to fall out of my ears. Definitely great value for the price.
"April 22, 2021",Rick Garza,5.0,,Awesome value and over delivered on my expectations. I have since ordered 3 more pair. I tend to sleep with earbuds and most earbuds get damaged. These so far seem very durable.
"October 12, 2020",Joe Parsons,5.0,,"I have had several wireless earbuds and these, by far, have the best sound.  I really like the fact that they have the hooks so that they will stay in place whether I am running or mowing the yard.

"April 29, 2021",John Whitaker,5.0,,So these are probably the best wireless headphones i’ve owned. I use these several hours a week mostly at the gym. The other day however the right ear piece became distorted. I contacted customer service and they already have a new one on the way. Must buy!!!  quality sound. Best ones so far
"May 24, 2021",Miss MSW,5.0,,Sound quality is great. Would definitely buy this brand again.
"December 29, 2020",AK,5.0,,"This is a great product with a reasonable price. They are pretty comfortable to wear with rubber bands. I also like the quality of the sound. The range of the Bluetooth connection works farther than I expected. Overall, I am satisfied with the most of its function!"

"May 6, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"My left earbud will no longer charge in the case.  Shame as I enjoyed this product and turned on several others from my gym to these.  I tried cleaning the contacts with alcohol.  The earbud appears to make good contact and seats like the right one, but does not charge.  The right earbud charges fine."
"May 21, 2021",Chassin,5.0,,Finally found wireless earbuds that fit my small ears
"February 22, 2021",Kim,5.0,,"These are exactly what I was looking for.  I wanted some that wouldn’t fall out because I have narrow ear canals.  I love that I can answer calls, ask Siri to read texts, start and stop audio books or music by pushing a button, skip tracks, and control the volume on the earbuds.  The battery life lasts 6 plus hours so far.  Highly recommend!"
"May 28, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,The sound is good. Connectivity was easy and fast. Good reception at a distance of 30 ft. or more from a transmitter. And comfortable to wear.
"September 19, 2020",Zeel Mehta,5.0,,"Great noise cancellation- though definitely not 100%- and beautiful audio quality. Comfortable to wear for a few hours- past that (though this may be because it's in combination with a face mask) it can make your ears hurt a bit. Battery on headphones lasts several hours, and case battery lasts for up to a week even when headphones are used frequently!"
"June 19, 2021",lady P,5.0,One,Can use either one to answer a call.
"November 3, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I like the way that they stay in my ears and how I can hear clearly and the person I'm talking with heard me clearly also!  The battery life is great also!

"December 18, 2020",Marjon,4.0,,"These headphones are great! Great quality sound! And the microphone works great as well. I just have the headphones for a couple weeks and it feels weird walking around the house without needing to hold my phone and being on a call with someone. Only minor thing, the lit of the case was a little bit loose just 2 days after I got it. Not sure how to tighten it."
"January 8, 2021",Mary G. Briggs,5.0,,"Just received my earbuds and am very happy with the sound quality. They were so simple to charge and pair, I was using them within minutes of arrival on my doorstep. I previously purchased a pair from another vendor and I could not get them to pair. I was so pleased this set paired so easily. This is a good product and I recommend purchase."
"February 17, 2021",LAC,5.0,,Seems ok so far; Bluetooth works well; pairs readily and has good range. Comfortable to wear and ear buds stay in place while jogging. Sound is good. Batteries and charging system perform well. The state of charge indicator adds a lot of value. (It's also nice to have the extra backup battery in the charger.)

"February 21, 2021",Roy B. Franz,1.0,,"Completely worthless, as it has trouble connecting, and won't stay connected.  If you want to hear ""power on"" repeatedly in your ears, this could be for you - otherwise, stay away."
"January 14, 2021",Caleb Sims,5.0,,Stay on your ear during workout. Decent noise canceling and great sound. Only wish the speakers were a bit louder. Clear sound will update if this changes with age. Bought some raycons and beats that just didn't age well decided to go a bit cheaper this time.
"May 18, 2021",love15122,5.0,,It holds a charge WELL!!! GREAT SOUND QUALITY!
"November 25, 2020",GeorgeU,5.0,,Overall they're a good set of earbuds that don't fall off because of the ear clips.  Not too tight so comfortable to wear.
"December 8, 2020",Shiva,5.0,,"I like the soft quality of the earloop, doesn't irritate ears if you use it even for hours. The sound is very clear. One of the nice features is you get to know the quantity of charge on each (left and right ) earphone."
"November 19, 2020",Mojoman,5.0,,The sound is amazing so light weight I hardly know they are in. The battery life and range are great.

I love the digital battery charge display inside the case - very helpful for someone like me that works outside and likes to have info like that quickly! These headphones are insanely great for the price. Totally worth every penny and then some."
"January 10, 2021",Michael Dugger,5.0,,By far the most comfortable ear buds that I have worn. Excellent sound quality with plenty of battery life.

"January 1, 2021",BRENDA,5.0,,I really liked this product bought it for my husband for Christmas 🎄 he really liked it was a very good gift idea. He mainly uses them for when his cutting the lawn to exit the noise from the tractor with music.

"December 7, 2020",Alicia B Jackson,5.0,,"These wireless earbuds are great. I’d previously tried the earbuds without the ear hooks, but they kept falling out of my ears. With changing the ear caps, the fit is great and the ear hooks help them to stay in place. The noise cancellation feature is wonderful, as calls are clear. Good purchase for the price."
"May 1, 2021",Roughout,1.0,,The ear pieces are flimsy and will easily fall out unnoticed.
"April 9, 2021",Calvin L.,5.0,,I love these earbuds  Other fall out of ear and cost more.  My new ones are water proof so I can wait them swimming.  The sound is great also

"January 5, 2021",Victoria Givens,5.0,,I have had many cordless headphones over the years but they always had a connecting band in the back that twisted and was uncomfortable. These earbuds are truly wireless with great sound and noise cancellation. They are sleek and  non-bulky which is key for my workouts. The battery life is shown and charging is easy. No issues at all!

"June 15, 2021",peedee.max,5.0,,"These headphones are incredibly comfortable! The sound quality is great and battery life is awesome. Depending on your needs, the noise cancellation isn't going to shut out all sound BUT you if you need to be aware of your surrounds these are perfect. That is the reason for the 4 stars for noise cancellation. They re what I need."

"December 10, 2020",kristofer schmidt,3.0,One,Was great at first but after a few uses it's very sensitive and even tilting my head or my phone moving causes the sound on one of the earbuds to cut out momentarily.
"May 6, 2021",JK303,5.0,,"So far, so good! Right now, my I'm loving how these fit in my ears. Almost no earbuds fit in my ears properly. These stay in place straight out the box with no adjusting. The sound was good enough for what I need and more than satisfactory at this price point. Hopefully they last."
"April 5, 2021",Bev,5.0,,Everything is good. Just can't adjust upward sound control.
"February 15, 2021",LW,1.0,,"I wanted to use these bluetooth ear buds for doing Zoom meetings, etc. I normally wear hearing aids and I thought these would be suitable replacements during these online meetings, since I now use Skullcandy earbuds.

"June 7, 2021",Madonna Henson,4.0,,"Very good customer service, I had a problem activating my warranty and customer service was very quick to respond and help. The sound quality is excellent especially using the phone, they could hear me loud and clear. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I haven't tested the battery life fully."
"May 31, 2021",Sloth,3.0,,These headphones sound pretty good but they aren't loud enough if you work in a noisy environment.
"April 27, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I use these earplugs in the gym when working out, they help me keep focus. The sound quality is excellent, and they are very easy to operate. They also hold a charge very well. They come in a nice small compartment that also serves as a charger. I would highly recommend these earplugs."

"January 11, 2021",DaBlizz,5.0,,"These headphones are great out of the box. Setup was instant, simple, and very straightforward. Didn't even need to look at instructions. Transition from using one earbud to two seems seamless. Sounds better than my old Mpow Flame 2's, which was my main concern. I'll update this review later once I get more use in."
"July 5, 2021",Jerry O,5.0,,"Wow, received these earbuds quickly and ahead of schedule.  They are excellent.  I have tried to find a pair that exceeded my expectations.  These did that!

They're easy to pair and they have a good range if you want to put your phone down somewhere, mine's usually in my pocket.  I'm very happy with them."
"April 27, 2021",Kevin Hernandez,4.0,,Work great. Case battery goes a little quickly for my liking but they sound and feel really good. My only real complaint is that I get a buzzing static sound when I put the buds to charge in the case. Pretty annoying at work. That being said. Everything else about them is great but not 5 star worthy.
"January 9, 2021",Rosannadana,5.0,,I like having no cords while I'm taking long walks and listen to books on Audible.
"December 21, 2020",SJFecu,5.0,,I definitely recommend it. It works great and they also give you free gifts

I will test it out through the week and update this product but so far happy with my purchase. Great bass, sound, look, and easily connect to my phone."

"December 11, 2020",Therese,1.0,One,I bought these and have only used them twice.  I charged them for at least 12 hours and they lose their charge and die within 3 hours.  They are total junk and a waste of money.

"November 27, 2020",TriniBoi,5.0,,Occiam are far better than expected. It is obvious based on initial experience the proprietors are going to improve on the tech. In my best opinion they wanted to make sure sound quality/ connection stability and response to the various OS platforms were developed. This tech is too good to stop here.

"January 13, 2021",Alexandra Ferrer,5.0,,"Great heaphones, sound great, connect seamlessly, can use one or the other or both. Really good quality and like the two screens letting you know if the case is charged and the headphones are as well. Like others have said the case is great with the screens but the hinge feels soft. So just treat it with care (like a baby) and it should hold up nicely."
"December 24, 2020",no,5.0,,The headphones has great sound but it randomly disconnects from the phone while you are talking to people on the phone. Sometimes the two will work separately from each other. But overall it work well Sometimes.

"June 5, 2021",Daniel,4.0,,"I've just tried the earbuds for a couple weeks now and the sounds quality is pretty good, decent battery life that last long with the case that is actually a portable charger. They fit nice and smooth into the ears so the only issue for me is that when I use them at the gym and started to sweat a lot they turn off."
"January 4, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,These headphones are very nice but the case is a little fragile. My husband works as a cell phone tower repairman and I bought him a pair for Christmas. He dropped the case and it broke at the hinge but he just taped it. So the headphones were great but the cases a little bit fragile his old tws headphones had a different kind of case.
"January 23, 2021",dwoodward2127,5.0,,Great sound and easy to use.  I wear them when I workout and they cancel the noise around me so I can focus on my workout.  Recommend these and they don't fall out of you ears like others do when I lay on the bench at the gym.
"February 24, 2021",Rick,5.0,,Awesome product great price sound is great very easy to use
"January 15, 2021",Davian Russell,5.0,,"At first I was just trying an ear bud with a different style but I am pleasantly surprised. It has exceeded my expectations. It is comfortable on the ear, has great loudness and good battery life. You will have no issues with these. Good buy"
"May 28, 2021",A. Brasfield,2.0,,"The pair often gets out of sync , so on ear is a second or so ahead of the other. They also connect and disconnect at random."

"December 17, 2020",Yvette Million,5.0,,So far so good. Very comfortable.  Need to read up on how the headphones  functions.  Love the case and not sure how to tell if it is charging or if it needs to be charged except when it informs me that it needs to charge.  I really like how they fit on my ears and like that I can use one or two ear pieces.
"May 30, 2021",Diego Bonometti,3.0,,"I can't connect these back on my phone. I hit the ""forget"" option and let them go all the way until 0% and afterwards won't connect still. They sound good though. The only thing I would do is add an ""L"" and an ""R"" so you know which eat to use because it can be confusing."
"May 6, 2021",Senyo Dabo,5.0,,Comfortable fit with good sound.
"October 7, 2020",KAY M.,5.0,,These are very sleek and fit perfectly in my ear! The sound is also pretty good. Happy with this purchase.
"May 2, 2021",L. Torrence,4.0,,"These ear phones are really good. The functionality take a bit to get use. Otherwise they are very nice. The battery life is outstanding. The sound quality is good, but not great. The base is what makes these worth a look."
"May 18, 2021",Minh Dang,5.0,,"I liked how easily openable the box was and how easy it was to connect to my phone Sound quality is great, and I really like how snug it fit around my ears. This'll make it really hard for them to fall out during rigorous exercise."

"March 21, 2021",H. Jax,1.0,,Stopped working a day after return deadline
"April 26, 2021",joshua,5.0,,The only downside I see is there is no l or r on the headphones themselves and the case lid isn't very stable. Just drops closed.
"April 8, 2021",Amber,5.0,,These are fantastic and exactly what I need for my yoga practice. I can do any pose without worrying about wires or an earbud falling out. I especially like that they have a mic so that I can teach yoga via video chat.

"March 7, 2021",ND144,5.0,,I like the case and how the earbuds made. Let’s you know when call is coming in! That’s Great! Just don't  like the sound quality. Can't hear clear! Seller is willing to work with you to make sure your satisfied!
"March 20, 2021",Melissa Kelley,3.0,,I wouldn't suggest these earbuds they aren't the best and you can get better for the same price. Another thing is the reason why there are so many 5 star reviews is the website gives you a free lifetime warranty if you rate it 5 stars.
"December 28, 2020",Cindy DeStefano,5.0,,These headphones are great. The sound quality is great and you can hardly hear any background noise when the earbuds are in. Battery life is not as long as I thought but I use I one earbud at a time and I can make it through a 12 hour shift. So overall great product

Highly recommend them. I appreciate that the charging case clearly shows percent charged (for the case and each earphone).  Such a clever design.
"January 21, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,"I ordered the Occiam brand wireless earbuds, and they're literally BETTER than the PowerBeats I got on Black Friday back in 2018. Packaging was excellent, design is sleek and easy to wear. The charge lasts forever and the bass is unreal. I needed a good set for when I work out, and it's exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend."
"January 16, 2021",Dallas,5.0,,First impressions are awesome so far! Great sound quality for a good price!
"December 14, 2020",Mary H,4.0,,I was hesitant to order earbuds as I have not had success in the past. These are comfortable to wear and I like that I can only use one when I walk or use them at work so I have my other ear unblocked to pay attention around me. The case is compact and easy to take with me.

One issue I see is I could not hear my wife's voice over the phone call when she was driving which is noisy condition. I guess the noise cancellation aldo cancel voice when environments are very noisy but not sure."
"May 20, 2021",sierra sunshine,5.0,,very comfortable in ear and clear sound. So far so good. Doesn't fall off my  ears and for me it's hard to find a good bluetooth I can wear all day.

"August 12, 2020",Kaison,5.0,,Wanted some lightweight headphones that sound good and easy to connect. These fit the bill perfectly and highly recommend! Stop wasting your money on Apple EarPods 😂

Battery life on the ear pieces is great, however the case only holds enough charge for one (full) recharge. Had a defective case, reported it and got a replacement within 2 days (UPS picked the old one up from my house, no charge). Been using it in steamy bathrooms with no issues. Very happy overall."
"January 27, 2021",Debbie,5.0,,These headphones have been great!  They cancel noise perfectly so I'm able to hear the caller even while driving a loud truck.  They are comfortable and do not bother my ears even when wearing them all day.
"December 10, 2020",Tracy,5.0,,"Absolutely nothing I dislike, my son discovered them so I am buying another pair."
"February 4, 2021",Shawn,5.0,,"Awesome sound quality, great fit, and outstanding overall product!"

"February 24, 2021",Corbyusa,5.0,,Slick design great sound. Long battery life
"January 5, 2021",Doug,5.0,,I like the way they stay in place with 3 size options for the earpieces. They came with medium installed and I struggled to keep them inserted. I switched to small and they stay put now. I use them with my cell phone and my laptop. Very handy. Could use a little more bass sometimes but great earbuds all-in-all.
"May 19, 2021",Lisa K,5.0,,These earbuds are very nice quality and have great sound at an affordable price. I also like that they are comfortable and feel secure.

But these ear buds definitely surprised me. I love bass in my music and these earbuds definitely have a sound quality better than what I paid for them. Very surprised and satisfied."
"May 18, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,I absolutely love these wireless headphones.  The beat feature is it's ability to stay in and around my small earlobe.  Bonus feature is the noise cancelling that I experienced on my flight.  The sound is clear and the battery life is durable.  Highly recommend this product.

I've tried many other earbuds but they usually fall out of my ears or end up hurting after long use but theses things stay in my ears no matter what I'm doing and they don't hurt my ears after long periods of time.

"March 19, 2021",syed,5.0,,This product is the best Bluetooth  headphones you can buy for the money by far. Great battery life very durable and overall better than my Samsung hearbuds that I bought I month before these. They crapped out and these are still going strong

"October 29, 2020",Kenneth,5.0,,"Sound quality is great for the price, but not in the same league as name-brand.  I love having a battery meter for the case and individually for each earphone.  Don't put them in the charging case sweaty or wet or the terminals will corrode. Quality of build is the worst part.  You can hear the plastic moving when you push buttons while they are in your ears."

My brother is a gamer and talks on the phone all day long. In both cases the Occiam Bluetooth Headphones are comfortable.
"December 3, 2020",Christian Partee,5.0,,"Quality sound with comfort over a decent time, small on the ear and wont slip off. thus far i enjoy this for its rather modest price tag.

But overall I highly recommend these"
"April 28, 2021",Eric,5.0,,Sound quality is great.

"December 30, 2020",John-Paul,5.0,,These headsets have been amazing. The sound quality is great and they fit perfectly for me when exercising.
"January 10, 2021",Troy,2.0,,"Volume is low and the volume controls only work for a few minutes after you rest them, then they won't adjust up or down.  I tried to deal with it for about a week and it just wasn't worth it.  It paired just fine and the calls were clear.  Battery life is great and all of the functions worked perfect except for the volume controls.  I am disappointed."
"December 7, 2020",Amazon Customer,5.0,,This is a solid product for an affordable price. Very happy with the sound quality and battery life. I love the digital battery display on the inside of the case. I use them in the gym everyday and they perform great. Will definitely recommend to friends and family.

When talking to family and work, they have all complained saying they could not hear me well. As far as the sound when listening to music and YouTube, it is manageable."
"March 15, 2021",Amazon Customer,3.0,,"Recently lost my Apple Airpods, needed a replacement and thought these would be decent enough. Sound quality versus the airpods is instantly noticable and is a major downgrade. It plays sounds. Yep. On the positive side, the battery life is much, much better than the airpods.

I now have an extra errand to run and garbage headphones. Thanks.

"December 2, 2020",Dixon Cider,1.0,,When you put these headphones on it’s like you’re floating on a cloud to the dumpster. The quality makes you feel like you just finished an our of dollar store shopping. If you’re looking for an expensive piece of crap these are the headphones for you.

They’re comfortable, easy to sync, and don’t fall out of my ear when I’m out for a jog.  Even surround sound with left/right and front/back targeting was realistic.  Very impressed!"
"November 29, 2020",FRANK KANG,5.0,,I don't usually go for Bluetooth earbuds with a hook because they're often uncomfortable for me but I wore these for a few hours and my ears felt fine. The sound cancellation also works very well and sound quality comes out pretty clear too. It connects to my pc and phone both without any problems.

"December 29, 2020",Aaron Brown,5.0,,I’m always skeptical when buying cheaper headphones. I’ve always had the theory that you get what you pay for when it comes to technology and especially headphones. But I was amazed how good the quality is. Would definitely buy these again.

"April 5, 2021",naéum,5.0,,I like the charging feature and the adjustable volume. The best thing is that I needed this when doing excessive movements (exercise) and that is why I needed this.
"November 16, 2020",ArmyVet717,5.0,,"Bought these for my daughter's school work. The battery life is ""ok"", but I'm hoping this is just because they weren't fully charged. Other than that, she feels good wearing them, and they actually fit her ears."

Often had to stop and remove them as the left earbud repeating, powering on over and over and over and over and over again."
"April 19, 2021",Payton,4.0,,Great sound and easy connection with cool charging feature. 2 downfalls are that they randomly power off then back on a few times while I’m exercising and will randomly turn on while I’m not even using them and then repeat to turn on after I’ve turned them off.

"June 7, 2021",Bryan Agudelo,2.0,,After a couple of months the ear piece starts to restart by it self. From out of the blue it gets desconnected and takes 5 min to reconnect or simply it connects then disconnects. For long term its not worth it

"May 19, 2021",Amazon Customer,4.0,,The larger case makes it easier to lose each headphones as I would usually carry the case in my pocket. I've lost both and found 1. I got them because of the rubber extension to help keep them on my ear while working out. That seems to work well.
"June 27, 2021",Suzanne Griffith,4.0,,"Sound quality,  noise cancellarion and battery life all excellent. The only reason I did not give a full 5 start review is the earpod on my right ear is umcomfortable after a while. The left fits perfect. I even changed the size of the ear tips but to no avail."

"February 20, 2021",Chris Brookins,3.0,,"Its not bad. It does have a bad habit of party lining or disconnecting art random. If I'm watching yputube or Netflix it's fine, when I take a call one bud drops the signal and the other will hold on."
"January 29, 2021",Jason Kruse,3.0,,These earbuds had a serious echoing problem when trying to hear someone else talk to you through them or even listening to an audio. The words would echo several times in a row making it very difficult to understand what was being said.

"February 1, 2021",Amazon Customer,5.0,,The sound quality is awesome!
"January 5, 2021",L Boettcher,2.0,One,"I purchase these earbuds on January 2, 2021.  Thus, I have been using them for about 35 days. The seller claims these earbuds have noise/sound cancellation.  It is true that they have ""passive"" noise cancellation.  This mean, if you use the correct size tips they will block your ear canals and thus, block external noise from entering your ear. There is no active cancellation technology. The passive cancellation is acceptable if used properly.  However, users may find that the snug fitting tips to be uncomfortable. The sound quality is a little better than what could be expected from lower end earbuds.  These do not have high fidelity. Mid-range is very acceptable, high range is there but not crystal, the low range is also there but a tad muddy.  Most casual users should find the sound acceptable but no great.  Those wanting a ""Booming"" low end will be disappointed. Construction seems solid. The volume buttons are easily used.  The Play/Pause/Next button is stiff and when pushed presses the earbud into the ear, which is uncomfortable.  This is one of the major drawbacks. The charging case and function are disappointing.  After charging the case the case charges the earbuds. After the initial set-up, which is quite simple, the buds should automatically pair with your device when removed from the case, and automatically turn off when replaced in the case.  I have found that they earbuds do not always pair automatically with my phone and have developed issues pairing with each other.  As well, they do not always turn off when returned to the case and when they are off they may turn on if the case is giggled in my pocket. Conclusion: These are higher low end earbuds.  Not the worst I have ever used, but not great.  My major issues Bluetooth pairing.  If I can not pair them to my phone and each other they are useless.  I would not recommend these earbuds."

"December 25, 2020",Hubert McMillan,5.0,,This is my first pair of true wireless earbuds and im 100% satisfied with them. Calls are clear and music sounds amazing. The big part is the battery life i use one at a time and In a 16 hr work shift i had to swap just once
"January 21, 2021",Paula Baker,5.0,,These are comfortable ear buds.  I usually have trouble using earbuds because they fall out of my ears.  These fit my ears well and do not fall out. The sound quality is good and so is the battery life.

But, as soon as I unplug the box from the charger the box starts to deplete its charge without even removing the ear buds. If left until the next day no charge left. I have another wireless bud set and bought these mainly as a back up because I thought I had lost one of the ear buds from my APEKX-BE1028W that I highly recommend. They take a charge in their box and it lasts for days and days, even when recharging of the buds is needed."
